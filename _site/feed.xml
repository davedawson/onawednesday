				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m on my lunch break right now. I work in this building over here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Do you enjoy it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What’s your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five minutes before 4pm. [What happens at 4pm?] Work ends and I get to go home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same exact thing. It’s like that movie, Groundhog Day, everything is the same, every day. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm waiting for my wife who has a 12:30 appointment in this building over there. Then we're going to go home we’ll cook some dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What time did you wake up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh man, I woke up at 5:30 this morning. [is that when you leave for work?] Well, that's when I head out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Where do you live?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We live out by Coney Island. We took the subway here today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What is your favorite part of the day? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12 noon. That’s when I go to prayer at the church over on Fulton. I like it. It keeps me focused and away from the shenanigans of the city.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m working here. Selling hotdogs, waters, gatorades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;How long have you been doing this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 week. I’ve been in this country for 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What time did you wake up this morning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I woke up at 8am. Then I took the subway here. I clean my stand, wipe it down and then my boss brings it here. I’ve been here one week, my boss was on this corner for four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Do you enjoy this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I enjoy having a job. In this country people are just lucky to have a job. So I’m happy that I have this. Before, when I didn’t have a job, my head was all over the place. But now I’m focused.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
