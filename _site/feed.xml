				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just took a ride around Manhattan on a bike. I already worked out in the morning, so I ran out of gas after 20 miles. So I’m taking the ferry back. I didn’t feel like going back over the 59th Street Bridge. I can handle it, but it’s too hot now. I came over the 59th Street Bridge, and went over through Central Park and then over to the West Side Highway and picked up the ferry over here to go back to Long Island City, where I live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m going to go home and check on my dog, and then he has to go for grooming at 3 p.m. Then I’ll go for dinner later in the city with my girlfriend. It’s  a day off, you gotta enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably just about right now. Being outside is great and this ferry ride helps to cool off. By the time I get off I won’t be sweaty anymore. So this is the best part of the day, right here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have to go back to work, so I won’t be out here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m on a visit. A ferry ride, just came from the heat in New York. I’m going to the Staten Island ferry. Sight seeing, I just want to get out of Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, I don’t have plans really. I just decide continuously what I feel like doing. Go in a restaurant, have some lunch, how I feel. No stress, no time pressure on vacation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, it’s breakfast time. Entering the coffee shop, relax and drink a coffee. Start the day in a relaxed way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no idea. I think I will decide tomorrow morning. Take the city map and what will come, I don’t know yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m seeing city sights all day. I started off on 51st st., in Midtown. I was planning to visit Williamsburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the sunset. That hour of the day. The temperature is better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, maybe seeing the upper part of the city. Central Park, and Riverside Park.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m watering my plants here. It’s turned out to be a beautiful day here in the hot sun. So, I have to haul a lot of water in because I’m at an antique show and they need tender, loving care. I’m the plant lady at this show. I’ve been doing it for 20 years or more. So I have a lot of repeat customers. I’m known for my plants and other things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Are you here all day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I’m here all week. I’ve been here since Saturday, setting up. I’m here until Saturday or Sunday. It depends on how much I sell and what the weather is like. I’m here for the duration. I never leave early. Nobody leaves from this field. Other fields, people will stay for a few hours or a day. We all stay. We’re very committed to everyone staying here. We have customers all week long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What’s your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just love it all. I absolutely do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m happy when I wake up. I sleep here too. I sleep either in my van with my little dog, Ted. Or we sleep in a tent in the back. We’re very happy. We’re happy when we wake up. I make coffee. Fresh ground beans. I know how to travel. And I love seeing my customers. I have a lot of repeat customers, because I’ve been here so long. So I love seeing them again. It’s more than business, we hug. We talk about real things going on in our lives. It’s friendships over years. I’m happy all day long. By the end of the day, I’m happy to have a glass of wine and I have dinner with friends. We either do something here on the field or we go to a nearby restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same thing. Same old, same old. You know, water the plants, take good care of them so that they look really good. Bag up some more potpourri. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, I’m constantly redecorating the booth, moving things around. This table has been there a while, move that, maybe move this over, change things on top of the tables. They look different placed in a different arrangement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love this booth because it has shrubbery around it and it kind of goes with my stuff. I’m really happy in this space. I tried other fields before finding this one, and I’m really happy here. And this is my gypsy family. We convene, we gather as a group. It’s very sad at the end of September Brim, because we won’t see each other until May. We keep in touch with email or Facebook, but it’s not like being together. I’m very fond of my neighbors. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What am I doing? I’m hanging out in Brimfield. I had a little bit of fun though. I’m going to be here all day. I’ll be here until Sunday. It’s an awful lot of work. So when you get tired and discouraged, you just have fun. You go to your neighbors, you steal some letters, you spell out some things. As long as it’s not too naughty. I don’t want to get kicked out of the field. But it’s a beautiful day. It’s gorgeous out. I people watch too while I’m here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how many years I’ve been coming here, you’ll have to ask one of these other folks. I shopped here 30 years ago. This might be year number six that I’ve actually set up here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like first thing in the morning. I get up at like 4. Nobody else is up, it’s quiet, it’s dark. I have my coffee and I can take my time to set up and do my thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same thing. I might do a little shopping tomorrow. Just in this field, this is the best field. It’s just comfortable, it’s easy going, not just straight rows of tents. I think this used to be a campsite. I get along with everybody in here. Everybody is pretty cool in this field. It’s only sometimes the patrons are fighting with each other. It’s entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm working until 10 this morning, then probably go home and take a nap because I was here at 6. And then I have a basketball game at 6:45, then I'll probably go out after to some party at 9:30. And then I have school in the morning, so that's it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What’s your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably the nap part. It's relaxing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have school. First day of school at Queensboro.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm working for MTA, doing customer service. I'm letting everyone know that there is no R service going Brooklyn bound. I'll be here until around 12:20 - 12:30. I've been here for two weeks straight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work general field, so I could be anywhere. I could be at a station, giving information on how to get to your destination, or I can be riding on the bus, doing a ride check. So I could be doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What’s your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting off. I actually work two jobs, so I leave here and go to another one. Everyday I work two jobs besides Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Because Thursday and Friday are my days off with the MTA, and then I'm a custodian at PS179 and my days off are Friday, Saturday there. I need to rest at least two or three hours in a day. Sometimes I'm just tired. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I'll be working as a custodian. Just a custodian tomorrow. But Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, it's pretty competitive with the two jobs. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to go to college at the college of Staten Island. I'm studying biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What’s your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I get home. Because I'm going to be late to my house. I'll be really tired. I just study two days, from the morning to the night. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lunch break. Yep, work and lunch. I work for the courts system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What is your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This right here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going home first, this is second. Because leaving the city for the suburbs or Staten Island is more my style than being here in the city and working in Downtown Brooklyn. So this is a nice escape here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably the same thing. Going to work, coming down here if it’s nice out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just hanging around, it’s a nice day. Just walked from home here, and I was going to walk over the little swinging bridge, but it’s closed. Usually I don’t come around here. Usually I go Pier 6. I think they’re working on the bridge, maybe it’s too swingy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What is your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late afternoon. Right before dinner, it’s not so cold, it’s not so hot.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow will be a nice day too, so I might be out for a little bit. I usually go to the gym, but today was a nice day so I wanted to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, right now I’m working for the DEP, so it’s just another day at work. After this, I’m planning to go home. I’m not really sure what I’m going to do. Hopefully find something fun to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in Staten Island. So it will take me a few hours to get home from here. Around two, usually. Hope this will help me out in the future, getting a permanent job at the DEP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a summer internship. I started in early May and it will end around mid-August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My job entails coming to one of these fountains at a certain location, usually at Brooklyn Bridge, City Hall, or Union Square. We just tell the public about the benefits of New York City water. Try to get them to use tap water instead of bottled water, to help preserve the environment, not waste so much plastic and money. Especially living in the New York, the tap water is so great. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d like to say the end of the day, because it gets kind of tiring standing out here for about seven or eight hours a day lecturing people. It has it’s perks, but the end of the work day is definitely my favorite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I’m working at Union Square. I’ll be there around 9:30. And at night I have  a birthday party to go to up in Queens at a hookah lounge. So, that should be fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m just on my lunch break right now. I’ve got about an hour left, so I’m just taking it easy. I work in a finance firm in DUMBO and we do a lot of work with financing for copy machines and green energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Favorite part of the day is when I go home. I’m a runner, so I like to run at night. It kinds of gets in the way of work, but what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same thing. Working, coming out here for lunch if it’s nice out. Then hopefully tomorrow night, I’ll take my girlfriend out to dinner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing bridge, as soon as my compadres come. I'm retired, so I can do whatever I want. I'll be here until about four o'clock, that's when we finish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I wake up. Because God has been good to me, I'm not dead. That's my favorite part of any day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God willing, playing bridge and counting my money. Then I'll get on my phone and call my lawyer and see what I'm doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanging out in the park and enjoying the weather. People watching, actually. Meeting friends later, and then getting some work done this afternoon.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What is your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably dinner. We know we're together for dinner, always. That's when we recap the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I have an interview. So I'll be prepping for that all morning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Fran</title>
				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well mostly, I have been retired and I'm doing whatever I please today. As I do most every day. I'm going to go up to a friend's. Right now I'm sitting in the park reading my paper. I do that every morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my backyard. I live two blocks away, over on Waverly and I love living in New York. I love it. I don't know why anybody would want to live anywhere else. Well, that's a little extreme. This is like my backyard. I like coming over here in the morning, I'm too old to enjoy the afternoon and evening nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What is your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd have to say, probably morning. Just because I'm an early person. I didn't like to get up and go to work, but I like to get up in the morning. I was a runner for a long time, and ran in the mornings. When my running was over, the best part of my day was over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's odd, most of my friends that are retired think I'm nuts. &quot;Why don't you sleep late?&quot; Well, sleeping late has never been something I want to do. So yeah, that's the favorite part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gee, I haven't thought that far ahead. I'm going away on Saturday, so I'm taking care of some things for that. I'm going up to Maine for a few days. Some shopping, seeing a friend, nothing very dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Reuben</title>
				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I woke up early, so I'm going to skate for a while, then go to work. And then probably meet up with some friends afterwards, kick back a little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably the morning. I'm an early riser, I just wake up and I'm ready to go. I get out before a lot of my friends do. I get a lot more time skating, which is nice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I have work, so similar to today. Until I get off for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, this morning I am sitting. I am sitting in the sun at the park. It's a perfect morning for it. It's not hot, it's not humid. It's just a lovely way to start the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Do you do this often?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as we can, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Couple times a week? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It kind of depends. Once it starts getting warm, then it's not a good place for it. What I'll do on some mornings is, where I live it's a corner and the cross breeze is coming from two directions. So I'll just take, well not this chair, but a regular lawn chair and sit by the corner, by the apartment building, get the cross breeze, do that for an hour. Usually I read my newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;So you're in a bigger apartment building?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;So you can't just sit out on the stoop or anything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, I don't have a stoop anymore. And I don't have a terrace, I would love a terrace. It's on the list of things I'd love to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;And how long have you lived around here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't live in the heart of Bay Ridge, I'm sort of on the border. But basically, I've lived here for 45 years. My grandparents lived a block from where I live now. All my life, basically. I actually grew up in Bensonhurst, on 14th avenue, right across the street from the golf course. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;And who do you live with now? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sister. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;And what time did you wake up this morning? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6 o'clock. In the winter I sleep later and go to bed late. Go out when it's warmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What is your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do like the early morning. I like the quiet of the early morning. When you can open the windows and listen to the birds. And then, again I like late nights. It's quiet. I like the quiet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow it's supposed to rain, and I have a doctors appointment at 3 o'clock. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm just getting a morning workout here. Pretty much, just shoot hoops in the morning. That's how I start my day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Every day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I try to at least. Three times a week, at least. I've been trying to get back in shape, so I figured this would be the best way to start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Do you live around here? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually live in Staten Island. But I work here and I have a lot of friends here. I usually come to Brooklyn a lot. I'm actually going to meet up with some friends after, so I figured I'd shoot here first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you guys going to do today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we're going to head over to a friend's house to have a little barbecue. Just have some people over, hang out and enjoy the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What time did you wake up this morning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I woke up around 6:30. Ate a little something, took a shower then headed out here. I've been here for about 30 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Who do you live with?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now I live with my parents and my brother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I don't know if I'll be able to shoot hoops in the morning, but tomorrow I'll be working. So I won't be able to play hoops in the morning. But I'll see if I can get some sort of workout in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;And what do you do for work? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work as a clerk in a hospital. I work evening shifts, so I work from 3pm until late at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What is your favorite part of the day? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably the morning. I'm a morning person. I feel like if you have a good start to the day, then the rest of the day should go pretty well. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well I went to try the bakery, Kayser. It's just around there. It's a French guy and they just started opening a new store and it's really, really good. I got bread and a raspberry financier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Is that all you have planned today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it's very private. But actually, I took the day off because I'm pregnant and I have a big doctor appointment, so I just didn't want to rush from work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Congratulations! That's really exciting. And what time did you wake up today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;And what is your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have an almost two year old son, so it's when I pick him up at daycare. He is all happy and I am happy too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to work. It's not so fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm shooting a student film, but the actor hasn't shown up yet. So these are some of the guys on the project. The director goes to New York Film Academy and he's waiting for the actor, who's over an hour late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn't usually happen. He's probably panicking more than me though. I'm just sitting here waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What time did you wake up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;How did you get over here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The F to the R, we met at Union Square and then walked up here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What is your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably evening. Usually because I'm done with work. I just like the light, and it cools off in the summer. It's nicer then. Early morning is nice too. I like the less hot parts of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I'm off, so I don't know, we'll see. I don't have to work. I've been doing some time lapse photography with flowers. So I have one flower that will hopefully will open. I did it yesterday, and I had it in the air conditioned living room and it didn't open. The kitchen is near the highway so it shakes. And it had leaves, so I'm going to cut the leaves off so they won't move as much. And I need the sun and the warmth. There's no air conditioning in the kitchen so I think it will open up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;So it's that fast that you can do this in one day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well it depends on the flower. I tried a flower outside in my garden from 6:30 to 9:30, but my camera starting overheating and it barely moved. I picked this dahlia and it's just really slow to open. Some I think will open. We'll see, I just started. This is my second flower. Hopefully I'll get some good stuff. I'm getting that flicker problem. Have you done time lapse before?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Not really. Is it shaking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not that it's shaking, it's the light changing. It reads like a flicker. I did one minute intervals yesterday, for about 7 or 8 hours. I kept it on the same exposure. The first time I did it — I just started doing these and if you change the shutter, I was changing to shutter to change exposure which was a big mistake. That was the first time I did it though. And I didn't do any research, it was kind of stupid. I just read how to use the intervalometer. But anyway, yesterday everything was consistent. I think the intervals are too long though so it fluctuates and it reads like a flicker. But it looked kind of cool. Even though nothing moved, the flower kind of breathed and went up and came back down. So yeah, I'm going to do that tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just hanging out here for a couple of minutes. I start work at 10 on 27th street So I biked down this morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm an acupuncturist. I've been doing it for seven years. I broke my back when I was 21 and that was the only thing that helped. I didn't end up getting surgery, but that was the only thing that was able to get the pain to go away. I was going to be a doctor before that, but after acupuncture worked, I was like &quot;fuck this shit, this is cool, I gotta learn how to do acupuncture so I can help people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;So it was that effective that you went and did it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Well, a lot of times in medicine, they're like, &quot;hey, let's see.&quot; It's someone listening to your problems, if something works even a little bit, it's a huge progress in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Do you enjoy it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love it. It's a lot of work sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been around Chelsea for the whole time. I've been in the office I'm at for four years now. But I'm moving in a couple of weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What time did you wake up this morning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6am&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Do you live by yourself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live with my fiancée.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the morning. And then the 15 minutes before I go to sleep. It's peaceful. In the morning I get to set up the intention of how the whole day is going to go and what I want to create. And at night it's nice to reflect on it and see what worked and what didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I have another office up in Westchester so I'll wake up early and drive up there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;You're not biking up there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, but one of these days I'm going to. It's only like 26 miles and there's a path. I'm in Mount Kisco so you can take the bike path all the way up the Saw Mill. They just don't have a shower up there, so it's been way to hot to just show up and start talking to people all sweaty. There's been days that have been bad. The A/C broke a couple weeks ago and I'm like blotting myself off with paper towels. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

I work in this building over here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Do you enjoy it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What’s your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five minutes before 4pm. Work ends and I get to go home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same exact thing.

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm waiting for my wife who has a 12:30 appointment in this building over there. Then we're going to go home we’ll cook some dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What time did you wake up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh man, I woke up at 5:30 this morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Is that when you leave for work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, that's when I head out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Where do you live?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We live out by Coney Island. We took the subway here today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What is your favorite part of the day? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12 noon. That’s when I go to prayer at the church over on Fulton. I like it. It keeps me focused and away from the shenanigans in the street.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m working here. Selling hotdogs, waters, gatorades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;How long have you been doing this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 week. I’ve been in this country for 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What time did you wake up this morning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I woke up at 8am. Then I took the subway here. I clean my stand, wipe it down and then my boss brings it here. I’ve been here one week, my boss was on this corner for four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Do you enjoy this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I enjoy having a job. In this country people are just lucky to have a job. So I’m happy that I have this. Before, when I didn’t have a job, my head was all over the place. But now I’m focused.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
