				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm making coffee most of the day. I'll go home, probably watch a little Netflix, and then hang out with my wife. That's basically my day today. Might go out to dinner. What is tonight? It's Wednesday. We'll probably go to Buttermilk Channel. We live in Carroll Gardens, so we'll probably be going there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My afternoon nap. I didn't add that before. I usually watch Netflix as I take my afternoon nap. I take a 15-30 minute power nap. That's my favorite part of the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I'll be here again, making coffee. That will be the extent of my day. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we are doing a bunch of different things. We are going to teach some kids how to play chess, how to play chess better. We are going to have an adult commercial chess league later on today that we’re preparing for. And, I will be leaving very shortly to train some of my star trophy winning chess champions in Queens to prepare for the national tournament. So it’s a full day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of the day is waking up and strategizing what it is that I want to get accomplished and how I’m going to do it. That’s really my favorite part of the day. It’s like a piece of paper, when you haven’t put anything on it yet. So the possibilities and your imagination run wild, and you’re thinking about all the cool things that you can write or draw or color. That’s basically how I see the day, until I get into it. Then it all changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is Thursday. Actually tomorrow is a little bit quieter. We have the after-school program, so we’ll be teaching chess to some kids tomorrow afternoon. We won’t be training, we’ll be working with kids who come here after school. We’ll be trying to get them to learn some better strategy and build their self-esteem a lot through chess. The kids that come on Thursday, there are two different groups. We have a very competitive, strong, strategic group of kids. Then we have the beginners, who are still trying to manage staying and paying attention. So Ms. Jillian is one of our best younger teachers. So, she kind of sits with them, but she’s new. So tomorrow we’ll be spending some time just making sure things that she needs to do and watching the kids learn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I came down to see Verizon about my phone. Somehow, my phone was going straight to voicemail. But I had it on airplane mode. I was telling the guy down there, knowledge is key. I didn’t bother to look at the settings and check airplane mode. Now I now. I learned something today. Later I’ll probably go pick my friend up from work and take him home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The morning, becuse I woke up. A lot of my friends, with the lifestyle I’ve lived are not here today. I am truly grateful for waking up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure. My schedule is that open. I’m definitely looking forward to it. I may jump in the van to help someone move tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Hopefully it’s not too nasty out tomorrow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t bother me. I’ve been through 66 of these things. Come on. I can’t understand the big uproar about the weather. But it’s always been a topic for conversation. In the Northeast, you’ve got to expect this. You think the people in Boston are complaining? This is not bad. The subways are out, people are all confused and discombobulated. Look at the street though, I fail to see the confusion. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m at work, selling cosmetic products. Later I’ll be listening to some music, because I love music. I also like to make music. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What kind of music do you make?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;R&amp;amp;B, but I just do it for fun right now. It’s a hobby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may sound crazy, but it’s the morning. You don’t know how the day is going to start. It’s spontaneous. It’s unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I’m doing the same thing. Working and networking with people, as usual. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, I’m at work all day today. I work at a retail store, I won’t say which one. But I’m just working today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing something active. I’m big on fitness, so usually I go to the gym after work or play a little basketball. That’s how I like to end my days. Being 6’4”, you kind of get thrown into sports early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is my day off. So what I usually like to do is start my day at the gym, because that’s the best part. Get myself in a good mood. I’ll probably hang out with some friends. I have a list of things that I want to get done throughout the year, whether that’s going to a good show, or taking a vacation. So I’ll try to cross something off the list.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just got down here. I’m waiting for my friend. I’m a student at LIM college and we had off today because school’s cancelled. It’s not really that bad out. She’s interviewing for a job around the corner. Not sure what we’re going to do, we’ll probably play it by ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess waking up. It’s a new day, a fresh start. I feel relaxed. Get ready to start the day and do whatever you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School isn’t cancelled tomorrow, so gotta go back to school. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m just coming from the Agenda trade show. I wish that my day was ending now, but I’m heading back to my office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking out of the office at the end of the day. Then I get to go off and do whatever I want. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very similar to today. The trade show is in town and it’s two days, so I’ll be back there. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ice skating, then going to Nelson A. Rockefeller Park, then watching a movie. Sort of a good Wednesday. I took off work today, so it should be eventful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably getting home. It’s relaxing. Usually I try to book my days. So I usually go to work and then the gym, maybe meet up with buddies and then just head home. That’s the best part of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also taking off work. My girlfriend is still in school. This is her last week, so I’m just trying to spend all my time with her. I have the next few months to just work my ass of, so that’s what I’ll do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am going over to sign a lease on a new apartment, then going to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of the day is mornings. I spend time reading my bible. It’s very refreshing to me, and revitalizing. That’s how I spend my morning: a cup of coffee and God’s word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I’m moving into my new apartment. And then going to work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m enjoying the view of Bryant Park, watching the skaters go by, enjoying the nice clear day, and enjoying myself.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably when the sun is out and it’s not too cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably just taking a walk around the city. Enjoying the sites of the Christmas season. I like to walk for exercise instead of staying home all cooped up, watching TV. I like to get out and get some pounds off. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to the Apple store to fix my Macbook. It had some problems, so I got it fixed. Now I’m about to meet with my sister. She’s over at 42nd, in Times Square. We were trying to decide if we should meet over there or meet over here. I think she’s going to come over here. So I’m just waiting for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably when I go home after a long day. Just coming home to a home cooked meal is my favorite part of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I’ll be taking a final. I have to take a philosophy final. I have to study tonight, it’s going to suck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m working at Starbucks. After work I’m going to go do some shopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving work to go home. Just sleep after a long day of work. I get here at 7 in the morning. It’s crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School. It’s finals week and it’s going to be crazy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Yuki &amp; Summer</title>
				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just visiting. We wanted to go to the United Nations building but we didn’t buy our tickets. But maybe tomorrow we’ll return to the United Nations building and tonight we’ll buy some tickets. This afternoon we’ll go to the Trinity Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grand Central Station. I searched for information on the website and found out about the kissing room. To say goodbye to their parents or their wives or husbands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll visit Broadway, the United Nations and Central Park.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m selling Christmas trees on 14th street &amp;amp; 9th avenue. Usually I’m here all day. The shifts run 12 or 11 hours. We have another stand over in Brooklyn. They have two shifts a day. One during the day and one at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting here is the easiest, you’re still fresh. By the end of the day, you’re cold and miserable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I’ll be back here. Same thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m decorating a Christmas tree stand that I’m working at. I’ll decorate the shopping cart that we deliver trees in. Mostly decorating before the rain comes. Opening trees, sweeping, there’s probably more on the list. It’s just a big list of really random Christmas tree stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably when I wake up at 6 in the morning. It’s all quiet and no one is around for an hour. I get to sit, drink coffee and think for a second. That’s my favorite part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same things, probably. Maybe more stuff geared towards the weekend. It’s probably going to be the biggest weekend. We’ll have all sorts of varieties of trees out. It’s going to be nuts, in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work from like 6 in the morning until 11 at night. Then the night guy comes and stays up all night for us. It’s a pretty intense month, but it’s good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selling Christmas trees. It’s our 26th season on Jane st. Thanksgiving is late this year, so it’s a short season. Man, has it been busy. We’re open 24 hours a day, until midnight on Christmas Eve. We sell or recieve something 24 hours a day. There are three of us, myself, my son and my son in law, and a bunch of neighborhood misfits who help us run the place. Actually, we couldn’t run it without them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spend eleven months in Vermont and one month is Manhattan. What could be better? Many of my customers are jealous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of a weekday like this is the mornings when I can sit here, drink tea, eat a bagel and greet people and talk. Usually by 10 a.m. it’s very busy. This morning, for some reason, by 8 a.m. it was very busy. So I didn’t get to do my little sit around and eat my bagel thing. But that’s my favorite part of the day. I love it. The sun hits me here. The people are greeting me every five minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of the whole deal is the people. Meeting the people and the relationships. But this is the Wednesday website, so my favorite part is sitting here and having people say Merry Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I’ll be doing the same thing. Same thing, same thing up until midnight on Christmas eve. We’re open 24 hours. I live right here on the corner, until midnight on Christmas eve. I might get a beer or pizza here and there. But mostly it’s right here where we’re standing selling trees. We used to be a small business, now we’re a big business in a small space. It’s very hectic. I have ten or twelve neighborhood kids working for me. It’s a riot here. If you like action, try Saturday morning at 11 o’clock. It’s a zoo here. There’s kids, people, trees, helpers. We got one big shipment of trees at the beginning, and now we get twice a week or more. We fill in with little orders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now I’m making mini-wreaths for a customer. I’ve just been doing some crafts. I’m not selling many trees, so I’m just making a few things. I start at 5 a.m. and try to go to bed around 9 p.m. It’s just for one month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m., I get the sun right there. That’s my favorite part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm visiting the famous spots in NY today. I'm from Tokyo on a trip alone for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today is the 4th day but the last day of my trip. Since it's sunny, I enjoyed the scapes of SOHO, and I've come here, the Brooklyn Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any time with plenty of sunlight. I love drinking coffee with views of Central park and Danvo in the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to leave NY at 10:30 a.m. for Tokyo. I've been so excited and inspired by NY and New Yorkers so far. This visiting makes me feel like challenging everything everyday for the rest of my life. I wonder if I'll have another chance to come to NY again and work in in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve just come across from the Statue of Liberty. We went on the helicopter tour this morning. We’re going to Ground Zero this afternoon. We’re just going over to Brooklyn now to get some lunch. Then we’ll hop back across for the 9/11 memorial and some Chinatown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve just put a lock on the side here. It’s similar to the one that they’ve got in France. The bridge where you throw away the key to symbolize everlasting love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well the helicopter ride was the best. We got to see everything from there. We got a bit of an idea of the layout. Times Square is pretty breathtaking. Quite intense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we’re going to do the Empire State Building tomorrow. And then just some shopping on 5th Avenue. We’re here for 6 days. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re going over the Brooklyn Bridge, to spend our afternoon there before we go back to Germany. Later we’ll go to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bridge, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow we have off. We’ll relax with jetlag.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m going to check out Manhattan. I got here yesterday, so we’re walking here, then to check out the 9/11 Memorial. Hope to get some dim sum in Chinatown, then maybe walk the High Line. I’m a tourist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably when I come home from work to see my girls. I have two girls. I get home from work, it’s been a decent day at the office. I get home and see them and disconnect for a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m going to go to the MoMA. Walk a little bit, see a bit of 5th Avenue and that whole area. Probably going to walk around the East Village. I’m not really sure, but I’ll definitely go see the MoMA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m cooking lamb and chicken for anybody. It’s good. I’ve been here since one or two o'clock. They have the bar here, everybody after they finish their drink, comes here to eat. I come here around 7 pm, until around one or two o’clock. If it’s busy, 2 o’clock. This cart is not mine. I work for three bosses. I work here and I work in a garage down the street, four blocks from here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cart here is the best, everyone tells me. I love everybody and everybody loves me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work at night. I see everybody here. These are my customers, I’ve worked here for two years. I know everybody here, and everybody knows me. I joke around with everybody like this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work tomorrow. It will rain tomorrow, so business will be slow. When you have rain or snow, I’ll see like ten or twenty customers. Everyone is at home. Tomorrow I’ll leave early because of the rain. My boss tells me there’s no business in the rain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m here after work. This is my friends’ place. It’s the biggest sports bar in Brooklyn. I came to get something to eat and talk to a couple people, see if they were interested in helping out and donating some time for the kids. It’s the &lt;a href='https://www.facebook.com/SecretSandyClausProject'&gt;Secret Sandy Clause project&lt;/a&gt;. If you know someone that needs a toy, you put down a toy that they want and they will get it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess when I wake up and have nothing to do. I can just kick back and grab a newspaper, grab a book and just relax. They are very far and few between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is an ordeal. I’m off tomorrow. I’ll go see my granddaughter and daughter tomorrow. It’s a great day. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I’m walking my dog in the park, I have a couple of appointments, and I have a meeting later on this evening. I am an international distributor of organic coffee and teas. I have meetings today around that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh actually this is one of my favorite parts of the day. Just getting out into the fresh air, the morning air, before all the fumes get into it. Having Fudge [the dog] interact with other pets, it’s just wonderful. I enjoy it very much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I have a workshop. I’m a psychologist and I do workshops on stress management. So I have a workshop tomorrow at 8:30 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had breakfast already, in the park here. And now after I finish doing this crossword puzzle and the rest of the paper, I’ll go and get another paper and do the crossword puzzle. Then I’m going to take a long walk into Williamsburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m new to this area, so I like to walk, and walk, and walk. I’ll take a three hour walk this afternoon. I’m looking for something. I walked by it one day. On any one of the streets, just between Kent and Bedford. And, I came by a little theater that looked interesting, but I didn’t note it. So now I’m searching the streets. I’ve got to go find it. I started yesterday, did about three hours, walking around and I still have about eight more streets to do there. It looked like it was very small. So I want to catch that and see what their schedule is, and what they have there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I moved from Manhattan. Actually, I’ll tell you the whole story. I used to live on 36th St. And the guy, I knew he was having problems with the building, it was a five story walkup. And he kept on renovating the building, and not reporting it to the proper people. He’d be selling it to members of his family, so he’d have to start all over again.  So, finally the judge got fed up, told the Buildings Department and the Fire Department, go over there and if it’s illegal, shut it down. Out of about twenty apartments, there was only one legal apartment. And the fireman said to me, “it’s not yours.” So the Red Cross put us up in a hotel for two days and now I’m living at the Y, trying to save enough money to get an apartment. But hey, a lot of people have it worse than me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like this neighborhood, and I don’t think I can afford Manhattan anymore. So I’ve got to wait another couple of weeks, save some more money, and go to a real estate agent. I’ve gone to a couple to get an idea, and if I can’t find anything here, my niece lives in Astoria. She says “Uncle Frank, we’ve got plenty of room over here.” I used to go out with a girl there, so I know the area. I’ve hung out in it, what have you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here I like it. If I had all my stuff with me, I’d be working out for two hours in the morning. Jogging, pushups against the bench, I have these weights that I walk with and jog with. So I like to be near McCarren Park. There are other small parks, but the thing that keeps me going, like when I lived on the west side of Manhattan, I’d go up the river one time, and down the river the next day. It keeps you going. Here I can go around different trails and they’ve got the track over there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s my story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the late afternoon, when I sit down and have a few beers with some people around here. I’ve only been here six weeks and I’m already treated like family by a lot of people. I like the people here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I don’t find that today, I’m going to repeat it again until I find it. But I think I’ll find it today. If not, I’m going to go see the Tom Hanks movie tomorrow afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well I’m on vacation. I used to live here. And I’m actually walking now from Greenpoint, I think it’s Clay street. So, I’m walking all the way across the Williamsburg Bridge. I really have no plans. I’m choosing to not hang out with people and just kind of see where the day goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of the day is morning, definitely. It’s kind of quiet and cozy. People are just getting going, so it’s a good time to think and walk and look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well tonight I’m actually headed up to Cape Cod with friends from the city. We’re going to go up there for a few days. I live in Northern Michigan, Traverse City. I was in the city for ten years, and then after 9/11 I just wanted to go settle elsewhere. So I did! &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously attending Brooklyn Beta. Also visiting Brooklyn while I’m in town for a team meeting at Editorially. That’s my day today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting to hang out with a lot of good friends that I don’t get to see very often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn Beta, again. Pretty much the same thing, but I think I’m going to start off the day with a nice, long run through Prospect Park, which will be nice. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m at Brooklyn Beta. This is my first time, so I’m sort of figuring it out as it goes. It’s been fun. Nice to meet people and talk a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hard to say. Lunch was great. A friend of mine from Chicago is here, and  I noticed him and we ate lunch together. It was nice to catch up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll be here again tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m going to go to work later on. I teach. I’m going to go teach some courses, and then I’m going to go work on some projects this afternoon, some articles that I’m working on.  I teach media and communications. I teach advertising. I teach public relations. I teach mass communications. And I write, I have to write. I have to publish this stuff. It is pretty much a good day. Every day is a good day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a morning person. I enjoy the mornings more. I like to take it easy in the morning and then work later on in the day. And I get more work done in the evening than I do in the morning. That’s just a habit I’ve had in life for a long time. I like to work late in the night. I usually stay in my office until after midnight most often. I like coming out in the morning, there aren’t many folks around. I come out of my office, there aren’t many folks around. I don’t have anything against people, I like people. But the kind of work I do, just by nature, I spend a lot of time alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty solitary work. You’re either spending time reading other people’s works, that’s how you get to know people, is basically through their writing, or you’re spending time with your own thoughts. I think that’s almost a danger of the job, is that you spend too much time with your own thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar schedule.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well since it’s Indian summer, I’m taking more time in the morning to be outside and workout, although I have a lot of work to do. And I’m also on Pan American Organization, the translation committee, so half the day we’ll be in Manhattan, and then I’ll go to a meeting this evening. So half the day in Brooklyn, half the day in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The morning. Always. I like the light, I like the cooler temperature if it’s a warmer season. It always seems hopeful. I have this big shoot of energy around 2:30, and then I come out of that and then I’m better in the early evening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m taking care of admin stuff today. So I’ll get back to poetry tomorrow. It’s best in the morning, writing poetry. I do believe in the idea that when you wake up, you’re still open to some other sort of dream world and everything that is still going on in your subconscious, so it’s an effective time to write. And you don’t listen to the radio or bring in the bad news before you start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just took a ride around Manhattan on a bike. I already worked out in the morning, so I ran out of gas after 20 miles. So I’m taking the ferry back. I didn’t feel like going back over the 59th Street Bridge. I can handle it, but it’s too hot now. I came over the 59th Street Bridge, and went over through Central Park and then over to the West Side Highway and picked up the ferry over here to go back to Long Island City, where I live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m going to go home and check on my dog, and then he has to go for grooming at 3 p.m. Then I’ll go for dinner later in the city with my girlfriend. It’s  a day off, you gotta enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably just about right now. Being outside is great and this ferry ride helps to cool off. By the time I get off I won’t be sweaty anymore. So this is the best part of the day, right here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have to go back to work, so I won’t be out here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m on a visit. A ferry ride, just came from the heat in New York. I’m going to the Staten Island ferry. Sight seeing, I just want to get out of Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, I don’t have plans really. I just decide continuously what I feel like doing. Go in a restaurant, have some lunch, how I feel. No stress, no time pressure on vacation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, it’s breakfast time. Entering the coffee shop, relax and drink a coffee. Start the day in a relaxed way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no idea. I think I will decide tomorrow morning. Take the city map and what will come, I don’t know yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The temperature is better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, maybe seeing the upper part of the city.

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m watering my plants here. It’s turned out to be a beautiful day here in the hot sun. So, I have to haul a lot of water in because I’m at an antique show and they need tender, loving care. I’m the plant lady at this show. I’ve been doing it for 20 years or more. So I have a lot of repeat customers. I’m known for my plants and other things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Are you here all day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I’m here all week. I’ve been here since Saturday, setting up. I’m here until Saturday or Sunday. It depends on how much I sell and what the weather is like. I’m here for the duration. I never leave early. Nobody leaves from this field. Other fields, people will stay for a few hours or a day. We all stay. We’re very committed to everyone staying here. We have customers all week long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What’s your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just love it all. I absolutely do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m happy when I wake up. I sleep here too. I sleep either in my van with my little dog, Ted. Or we sleep in a tent in the back. We’re very happy. We’re happy when we wake up. I make coffee. Fresh ground beans. I know how to travel. And I love seeing my customers. I have a lot of repeat customers, because I’ve been here so long. So I love seeing them again. It’s more than business, we hug. We talk about real things going on in our lives. It’s friendships over years. I’m happy all day long. By the end of the day, I’m happy to have a glass of wine and I have dinner with friends. We either do something here on the field or we go to a nearby restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same thing. Same old, same old. You know, water the plants, take good care of them so that they look really good. Bag up some more potpourri. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, I’m constantly redecorating the booth, moving things around. This table has been there a while, move that, maybe move this over, change things on top of the tables. They look different placed in a different arrangement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love this booth because it has shrubbery around it and it kind of goes with my stuff. I’m really happy in this space. I tried other fields before finding this one, and I’m really happy here. And this is my gypsy family. We convene, we gather as a group. It’s very sad at the end of September Brim, because we won’t see each other until May. We keep in touch with email or Facebook, but it’s not like being together. I’m very fond of my neighbors. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What am I doing? I’m hanging out in Brimfield. I had a little bit of fun though. I’m going to be here all day. I’ll be here until Sunday. It’s an awful lot of work. So when you get tired and discouraged, you just have fun. You go to your neighbors, you steal some letters, you spell out some things. As long as it’s not too naughty. I don’t want to get kicked out of the field. But it’s a beautiful day. It’s gorgeous out. I people watch too while I’m here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how many years I’ve been coming here, you’ll have to ask one of these other folks. I shopped here 30 years ago. This might be year number six that I’ve actually set up here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like first thing in the morning. I get up at like 4. Nobody else is up, it’s quiet, it’s dark. I have my coffee and I can take my time to set up and do my thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same thing. I might do a little shopping tomorrow. Just in this field, this is the best field. It’s just comfortable, it’s easy going, not just straight rows of tents. I think this used to be a campsite. I get along with everybody in here. Everybody is pretty cool in this field. It’s only sometimes the patrons are fighting with each other. It’s entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

And then I have school in the morning, so that's it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What’s your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably the nap part.

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm working for MTA, doing customer service. I'm letting everyone know that there is no R service going Brooklyn bound. I'll be here until around 12:20 - 12:30. I've been here for two weeks straight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work general field, so I could be anywhere. I could be at a station, giving information on how to get to your destination, or I can be riding on the bus, doing a ride check. So I could be doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What’s your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting off. I actually work two jobs, so I leave here and go to another one. Everyday I work two jobs besides Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Because Thursday and Friday are my days off with the MTA, and then I'm a custodian at PS179 and my days off are Friday, Saturday there. I need to rest at least two or three hours in a day. Sometimes I'm just tired. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I'll be working as a custodian. Just a custodian tomorrow. But Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, it's pretty competitive with the two jobs. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

I work for the courts system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What is your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This right here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going home first, this is second. Because leaving the city for the suburbs or Staten Island is more my style than being here in the city and working in Downtown Brooklyn. So this is a nice escape here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably the same thing. Going to work, coming down here if it’s nice out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just hanging around, it’s a nice day. Just walked from home here, and I was going to walk over the little swinging bridge, but it’s closed. Usually I don’t come around here. Usually I go Pier 6. I think they’re working on the bridge, maybe it’s too swingy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What is your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late afternoon. Right before dinner, it’s not so cold, it’s not so hot.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow will be a nice day too, so I might be out for a little bit. I usually go to the gym, but today was a nice day so I wanted to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, right now I’m working for the DEP, so it’s just another day at work. After this, I’m planning to go home. I’m not really sure what I’m going to do. Hopefully find something fun to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in Staten Island. So it will take me a few hours to get home from here. Around two, usually. Hope this will help me out in the future, getting a permanent job at the DEP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a summer internship. I started in early May and it will end around mid-August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My job entails coming to one of these fountains at a certain location, usually at Brooklyn Bridge, City Hall, or Union Square. We just tell the public about the benefits of New York City water. Try to get them to use tap water instead of bottled water, to help preserve the environment, not waste so much plastic and money. Especially living in the New York, the tap water is so great. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d like to say the end of the day, because it gets kind of tiring standing out here for about seven or eight hours a day lecturing people. It has it’s perks, but the end of the work day is definitely my favorite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I’m working at Union Square. I’ll be there around 9:30. And at night I have  a birthday party to go to up in Queens at a hookah lounge. So, that should be fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m just on my lunch break right now. I’ve got about an hour left, so I’m just taking it easy. I work in a finance firm in DUMBO and we do a lot of work with financing for copy machines and green energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Favorite part of the day is when I go home. I’m a runner, so I like to run at night. It kinds of gets in the way of work, but what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same thing. Working, coming out here for lunch if it’s nice out. Then hopefully tomorrow night, I’ll take my girlfriend out to dinner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing bridge, as soon as my compadres come. I'm retired, so I can do whatever I want. I'll be here until about four o'clock, that's when we finish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I wake up. Because God has been good to me, I'm not dead. That's my favorite part of any day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God willing, playing bridge and counting my money. Then I'll get on my phone and call my lawyer and see what I'm doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanging out in the park and enjoying the weather. People watching, actually. Meeting friends later, and then getting some work done this afternoon.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What is your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably dinner. We know we're together for dinner, always. That's when we recap the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I have an interview. So I'll be prepping for that all morning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well mostly, I have been retired and I'm doing whatever I please today. As I do most every day. I'm going to go up to a friend's. Right now I'm sitting in the park reading my paper. I do that every morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my backyard. I live two blocks away, over on Waverly and I love living in New York. I love it. I don't know why anybody would want to live anywhere else. Well, that's a little extreme. This is like my backyard. I like coming over here in the morning, I'm too old to enjoy the afternoon and evening nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What is your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd have to say, probably morning. Just because I'm an early person. I didn't like to get up and go to work, but I like to get up in the morning. I was a runner for a long time, and ran in the mornings. When my running was over, the best part of my day was over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's odd, most of my friends that are retired think I'm nuts. &quot;Why don't you sleep late?&quot; Well, sleeping late has never been something I want to do. So yeah, that's the favorite part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gee, I haven't thought that far ahead. I'm going away on Saturday, so I'm taking care of some things for that. I'm going up to Maine for a few days. Some shopping, seeing a friend, nothing very dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I woke up early, so I'm going to skate for a while, then go to work. And then probably meet up with some friends afterwards, kick back a little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably the morning. I'm an early riser, I just wake up and I'm ready to go. I get out before a lot of my friends do. I get a lot more time skating, which is nice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I have work, so similar to today. Until I get off for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, this morning I am sitting. I am sitting in the sun at the park. It's a perfect morning for it. It's not hot, it's not humid. It's just a lovely way to start the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Do you do this often?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as we can, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Couple times a week? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It kind of depends. Once it starts getting warm, then it's not a good place for it. What I'll do on some mornings is, where I live it's a corner and the cross breeze is coming from two directions. So I'll just take, well not this chair, but a regular lawn chair and sit by the corner, by the apartment building, get the cross breeze, do that for an hour. Usually I read my newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;So you're in a bigger apartment building?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;So you can't just sit out on the stoop or anything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, I don't have a stoop anymore. And I don't have a terrace, I would love a terrace. It's on the list of things I'd love to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;And how long have you lived around here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't live in the heart of Bay Ridge, I'm sort of on the border. But basically, I've lived here for 45 years. My grandparents lived a block from where I live now. All my life, basically. I actually grew up in Bensonhurst, on 14th avenue, right across the street from the golf course. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;And who do you live with now? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sister. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;And what time did you wake up this morning? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6 o'clock. In the winter I sleep later and go to bed late. Go out when it's warmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What is your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do like the early morning. I like the quiet of the early morning. When you can open the windows and listen to the birds. And then, again I like late nights. It's quiet. I like the quiet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow it's supposed to rain, and I have a doctors appointment at 3 o'clock. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm just getting a morning workout here. Pretty much, just shoot hoops in the morning. That's how I start my day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Every day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I try to at least. Three times a week, at least. I've been trying to get back in shape, so I figured this would be the best way to start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Do you live around here? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually live in Staten Island. But I work here and I have a lot of friends here. I usually come to Brooklyn a lot. I'm actually going to meet up with some friends after, so I figured I'd shoot here first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you guys going to do today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we're going to head over to a friend's house to have a little barbecue. Just have some people over, hang out and enjoy the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What time did you wake up this morning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I woke up around 6:30. Ate a little something, took a shower then headed out here. I've been here for about 30 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Who do you live with?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now I live with my parents and my brother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I don't know if I'll be able to shoot hoops in the morning, but tomorrow I'll be working. So I won't be able to play hoops in the morning. But I'll see if I can get some sort of workout in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;And what do you do for work? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work as a clerk in a hospital. I work evening shifts, so I work from 3pm until late at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What is your favorite part of the day? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably the morning. I'm a morning person. I feel like if you have a good start to the day, then the rest of the day should go pretty well. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well I went to try the bakery, Kayser. It's just around there. It's a French guy and they just started opening a new store and it's really, really good. I got bread and a raspberry financier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Is that all you have planned today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it's very private. But actually, I took the day off because I'm pregnant and I have a big doctor appointment, so I just didn't want to rush from work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Congratulations! That's really exciting. And what time did you wake up today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;And what is your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have an almost two year old son, so it's when I pick him up at daycare. He is all happy and I am happy too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to work. It's not so fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm shooting a student film, but the actor hasn't shown up yet. So these are some of the guys on the project. The director goes to New York Film Academy and he's waiting for the actor, who's over an hour late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn't usually happen. He's probably panicking more than me though. I'm just sitting here waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What time did you wake up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;How did you get over here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The F to the R, we met at Union Square and then walked up here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What is your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably evening. Usually because I'm done with work. I just like the light, and it cools off in the summer. It's nicer then. Early morning is nice too. I like the less hot parts of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I'm off, so I don't know, we'll see. I don't have to work. I've been doing some time lapse photography with flowers. So I have one flower that will hopefully will open. I did it yesterday, and I had it in the air conditioned living room and it didn't open. The kitchen is near the highway so it shakes. And it had leaves, so I'm going to cut the leaves off so they won't move as much. And I need the sun and the warmth. There's no air conditioning in the kitchen so I think it will open up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;So it's that fast that you can do this in one day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well it depends on the flower. I tried a flower outside in my garden from 6:30 to 9:30, but my camera starting overheating and it barely moved. I picked this dahlia and it's just really slow to open. Some I think will open. We'll see, I just started. This is my second flower. Hopefully I'll get some good stuff. I'm getting that flicker problem. Have you done time lapse before?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Not really. Is it shaking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not that it's shaking, it's the light changing. It reads like a flicker. I did one minute intervals yesterday, for about 7 or 8 hours. I kept it on the same exposure. The first time I did it — I just started doing these and if you change the shutter, I was changing to shutter to change exposure which was a big mistake. That was the first time I did it though. And I didn't do any research, it was kind of stupid. I just read how to use the intervalometer. But anyway, yesterday everything was consistent. I think the intervals are too long though so it fluctuates and it reads like a flicker. But it looked kind of cool. Even though nothing moved, the flower kind of breathed and went up and came back down. So yeah, I'm going to do that tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just hanging out here for a couple of minutes. I start work at 10 on 27th street So I biked down this morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm an acupuncturist. I've been doing it for seven years. I broke my back when I was 21 and that was the only thing that helped. I didn't end up getting surgery, but that was the only thing that was able to get the pain to go away. I was going to be a doctor before that, but after acupuncture worked, I was like &quot;fuck this shit, this is cool, I gotta learn how to do acupuncture so I can help people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;So it was that effective that you went and did it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Well, a lot of times in medicine, they're like, &quot;hey, let's see.&quot; It's someone listening to your problems, if something works even a little bit, it's a huge progress in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Do you enjoy it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love it. It's a lot of work sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been around Chelsea for the whole time. I've been in the office I'm at for four years now. But I'm moving in a couple of weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What time did you wake up this morning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6am&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Do you live by yourself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live with my fiancée.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What's your favorite part of the day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the morning. And then the 15 minutes before I go to sleep. It's peaceful. In the morning I get to set up the intention of how the whole day is going to go and what I want to create. And at night it's nice to reflect on it and see what worked and what didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I have another office up in Westchester so I'll wake up early and drive up there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;You're not biking up there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, but one of these days I'm going to. It's only like 26 miles and there's a path. I'm in Mount Kisco so you can take the bike path all the way up the Saw Mill. They just don't have a shower up there, so it's been way to hot to just show up and start talking to people all sweaty. There's been days that have been bad. The A/C broke a couple weeks ago and I'm like blotting myself off with paper towels. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Work ends and I get to go home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What are you doing tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same exact thing.

Then we're going to go home we’ll cook some dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What time did you wake up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh man, I woke up at 5:30 this morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Is that when you leave for work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, that's when I head out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Where do you live?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We live out by Coney Island. We took the subway here today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What is your favorite part of the day? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12 noon. That’s when I go to prayer at the church over on Fulton. I like it. It keeps me focused and away from the shenanigans in the street.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I’ve been in this country for 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;What time did you wake up this morning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I woke up at 8am. Then I took the subway here. I clean my stand, wipe it down and then my boss brings it here. I’ve been here one week, my boss was on this corner for four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='question'&gt;Do you enjoy this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I enjoy having a job. In this country people are just lucky to have a job. So I’m happy that I have this. Before, when I didn’t have a job, my head was all over the place. But now I’m focused.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
