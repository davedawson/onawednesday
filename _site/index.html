      		<p class='question'>What are you doing today?</p><p>Well I’m a retired guy, and I went to a senior center for lunch and talked to some people. I left there and took a long walk, but it’s really windy today. I walked to Eighth Avenue because I wanted to go to the Joyce Theater. It’s a theater known for dance. I just was inquiring about their spring season. Now I’m heading towards Sixth Avenue to do a little shopping. Nothing much today. I’m busy Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. </p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>It all depends on who I’m with. I would say the afternoons. Mornings I tend to be home. I do a number of things, taking my time reading the paper, maybe have the TV on. I get out in the afternoon. I’ll go to the senior center, not all the days, it depends. I have various activities at the senior center too. It all depends on the schedule that they have. So I spend some time over there. Afterwards I return home, maybe have an activity in the evening.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>I’m going to the movies and then a Ukrainian restaurant on the East side.</p>

      	<div class="interview">
      		<p class='question'>What are you doing today?</p><p>Today is my first day of learning how to be a pit… person, pit rat, pit professional. It’s a long road. I’ve been with Hometown [Bar-B-Que] since the beginning and I’ve been doing carving for them. It’s been a great experience. I’ve been a cook for a while now, about three years. It’s been seven months at Hometown. Now we’re at the point where we need more people cooking and I’m next in line to learn the sacred art, as it were. It’s pretty awesome. It’s something I’ve been looking forward to in a lot of ways. Partly because it’s a different part of my personality I get to embrace. I’ve been talking to people a lot, I’ve been outgoing. I’m willing to pull part of that back, there are other ways I can do that. But the restaurant is an interesting place; the barbeque community is an interesting set of people. Honestly, the really interesting customers are the ones who are making barbeque at home. Those are the guys who are coming in and they really want to know everything about what you’re doing because they want to do it themselves.</p><p><a href='/with/ernie'>Ernie</a> is actually a pretty avid fan of the stuff we’re doing. It’s cool to see the stuff that he’s doing compared to the stuff that we’re doing. That’s one of the best parts about barbeque, it’s collaborative. There’s no hiding any secrets, there’s no pretension even, at least not in the circles that I’ve been running in. You just see a lot of really great people who are into the food they’re making.</p><p class='question'>Why is that?</p><p>There’s something really friendly about barbecue. I could see some people who are willing to keep it away. But Billy, our pitmaster said, if someone wants a recipe, just give it to them.</p><p class='question'>You don’t see that as competition?</p><p>Definitely not. No matter what I tell you about brisket, you are probably going to take a long time before you learn how to do it the right way. The recipe is literally just salt and pepper. It’s more about the technique. The shape that the fire is right now is reflective of what it was an hour ago. You have to know how much you’re adding and why you’re adding it. If you’re going to dampen the box, you have to understand why you’re doing it.</p><p>So, the whole idea with the fire is that every fifteen minutes or so, if you’re not keeping on top of it, you’re going to have a drop in temperature. You have to be constantly adding wood.The nature of it is that it’s a very hot fire and it burns the wood quickly, but it has a very clean smoke. That’s one of the big things about barbeque, you want a clean fire. To keep a clean fire, you need to keep feeding it. You have to know when to feed the beast, when to hold off. In a lot of ways it looks and feels like just hanging out by the smoker all day. It’s very different from much of the cooking I’ve done.</p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>Usually at the end of the day. I tend to be pretty nocturnal. I really enjoy getting out late and a long walk home. Just that exertion, that cool down. I’m done doing what I’m doing for today and now I’m just enjoying a little bit of peace. I like going home and seeing my roommate. It’s a funny thing. We’re pretty close and just hanging out with him, even if we’re not talking to each other, is still pretty excellent.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>I actually have no fucking clue. I might be here with this guy at two in the morning to do a lunch cook for tomorrow. I may be here doing that, or I may be in the back of the kitchen tomorrow night. I really have no idea.</p>

I have to go home because I have a few estimates done at my house. I’m having some stuff done to my yard. Other than that, I stop and eat wherever I want and run my business. Not much to my life, it’s pretty boring now. If you’d asked me fifteen years ago, it would have been a different story.</p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>Seeing my kids. I know that’s not interesting, but that’s my favorite, going home to my kids at the end of the day. My favorite part during the day is just being out and about. I get to visit my customers, do estimates, new prospects, just being out and about everywhere. I’m in Manhattan two days a week, Brooklyn two days a week, Queens, Staten Island, I’m everywhere. </p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow I will be doing pretty much the same thing, but I’ll be training two of my guys. It’s termite season now, so I’ll be training two of my guys to do termite work, drilling and that stuff.</p>

      		<p class='question'>What are you doing today?</p><p>This morning I went to work at a bakery/restaurant called Runner &amp; Stone. I went to work at one in the morning. So I got off of work around ten o’clock. And then I went to an art studio. I do oil paintings, and my art studio is a couple of blocks from Runner &amp; Stone, it’s called Brooklyn Art Space in Gowanus. I went there and finished my painting. And then I came here and I’m reading Game of Thrones.</p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>It’s hard to say because I had such an awesome morning baking bread. It was just one of those mornings where everything went really smoothly and I was really happy with my baguette shapes. So that was really good. Also, finishing a painting is a great feeling. It starts off as a blank canvas, so when you’re finished it’s a good feeling. And right now I’m up to a really good part in the book. It’s a beautiful day out, just one of those good days. </p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>I have off from work. If it’s this nice, probably just walk around. Walk over the Brooklyn Bridge or do something like that. If it’s not nice out, I’ll spend the day in my art studio.</p><p class='note small'><em><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> Ashley invited us into her home and shared some of her paintings with us.

I have a big song called TBHC, Keep Brooklyn Healthy, letting everyone know how to get to the hospital, where and how to get there. And also about our E.R. nurses, what they do for you when you come there and how you feel. So I’ll be in the studio later trying finish those up.
</p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I’d probably say around afternoon. I usually get off around 2. Working in the emergency room it gets a little crazy. Putting out supplies and materials all day long and trauma and everything else going on. But I would say when I get off, I relax a little bit.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>I’ll actually be going going to work tomorrow and then cooling off for the rest of the day.

We are going to have an adult commercial chess league later on today that we’re preparing for. And, I will be leaving very shortly to train some of my star trophy winning chess champions in Queens to prepare for the national tournament. So it’s a full day.</p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>My favorite part of the day is waking up and strategizing what it is that I want to get accomplished and how I’m going to do it. That’s really my favorite part of the day. It’s like a piece of paper, when you haven’t put anything on it yet. So the possibilities and your imagination run wild, and you’re thinking about all the cool things that you can write or draw or color. That’s basically how I see the day, until I get into it. Then it all changes.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow is Thursday. Actually tomorrow is a little bit quieter. We have the after-school program, so we’ll be teaching chess to some kids tomorrow afternoon. We won’t be training, we’ll be working with kids who come here after school. We’ll be trying to get them to learn some better strategy and build their self-esteem a lot through chess. The kids that come on Thursday, there are two different groups. We have a very competitive, strong, strategic group of kids. Then we have the beginners, who are still trying to manage staying and paying attention. So Ms. Jillian is one of our best younger teachers. So, she kind of sits with them, but she’s new. So tomorrow we’ll be spending some time just making sure things that she needs to do and watching the kids learn.</p>

I can’t understand the big uproar about the weather. But it’s always been a topic for conversation. In the Northeast, you’ve got to expect this. You think the people in Boston are complaining? This is not bad. The subways are out, people are all confused and discombobulated. Look at the street though, I fail to see the confusion. </p>

It’s just a big list of really random Christmas tree stuff.</p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>Probably when I wake up at 6 in the morning.

      		<p class='question'>What are you doing today?</p><p>Selling Christmas trees. It’s our 26th season on Jane st. Thanksgiving is late this year, so it’s a short season. Man, has it been busy. We’re open 24 hours a day, until midnight on Christmas Eve. We sell or recieve something 24 hours a day. There are three of us, myself, my son and my son in law, and a bunch of neighborhood misfits who help us run the place. Actually, we couldn’t run it without them.</p><p>We spend eleven months in Vermont and one month is Manhattan. What could be better? Many of my customers are jealous. </p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>My favorite part of a weekday like this is the mornings when I can sit here, drink tea, eat a bagel and greet people and talk. Usually by 10 a.m. it’s very busy. This morning, for some reason, by 8 a.m. it was very busy. So I didn’t get to do my little sit around and eat my bagel thing. But that’s my favorite part of the day. I love it. The sun hits me here. The people are greeting me every five minutes. </p><p>My favorite part of the whole deal is the people. Meeting the people and the relationships. But this is the Wednesday website, so my favorite part is sitting here and having people say Merry Christmas.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow I’ll be doing the same thing. Same thing, same thing up until midnight on Christmas eve. We’re open 24 hours. I live right here on the corner, until midnight on Christmas eve. I might get a beer or pizza here and there. But mostly it’s right here where we’re standing selling trees. We used to be a small business, now we’re a big business in a small space. It’s very hectic. I have ten or twelve neighborhood kids working for me. It’s a riot here. If you like action, try Saturday morning at 11 o’clock. It’s a zoo here. There’s kids, people, trees, helpers. We got one big shipment of trees at the beginning, and now we get twice a week or more. We fill in with little orders.</p>

And now after I finish doing this crossword puzzle and the rest of the paper, I’ll go and get another paper and do the crossword puzzle. Then I’m going to take a long walk into Williamsburg.</p><p>I’m new to this area, so I like to walk, and walk, and walk. I’ll take a three hour walk this afternoon. I’m looking for something. I walked by it one day. On any one of the streets, just between Kent and Bedford. And, I came by a little theater that looked interesting, but I didn’t note it. So now I’m searching the streets. I’ve got to go find it. I started yesterday, did about three hours, walking around and I still have about eight more streets to do there. It looked like it was very small. So I want to catch that and see what their schedule is, and what they have there. </p><p>I moved from Manhattan. Actually, I’ll tell you the whole story. I used to live on 36th St. And the guy, I knew he was having problems with the building, it was a five story walkup. And he kept on renovating the building, and not reporting it to the proper people. He’d be selling it to members of his family, so he’d have to start all over again.  So, finally the judge got fed up, told the Buildings Department and the Fire Department, go over there and if it’s illegal, shut it down. Out of about twenty apartments, there was only one legal apartment. And the fireman said to me, “it’s not yours.” So the Red Cross put us up in a hotel for two days and now I’m living at the Y, trying to save enough money to get an apartment. But hey, a lot of people have it worse than me. </p><p>I like this neighborhood, and I don’t think I can afford Manhattan anymore. So I’ve got to wait another couple of weeks, save some more money, and go to a real estate agent. I’ve gone to a couple to get an idea, and if I can’t find anything here, my niece lives in Astoria. She says “Uncle Frank, we’ve got plenty of room over here.” I used to go out with a girl there, so I know the area. I’ve hung out in it, what have you. </p><p>But here I like it. If I had all my stuff with me, I’d be working out for two hours in the morning. Jogging, pushups against the bench, I have these weights that I walk with and jog with. So I like to be near McCarren Park. There are other small parks, but the thing that keeps me going, like when I lived on the west side of Manhattan, I’d go up the river one time, and down the river the next day. It keeps you going. Here I can go around different trails and they’ve got the track over there. </p><p>That’s my story.</p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>In the late afternoon, when I sit down and have a few beers with some people around here. I’ve only been here six weeks and I’m already treated like family by a lot of people. I like the people here. </p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>If I don’t find that today, I’m going to repeat it again until I find it. But I think I’ll find it today. If not, I’m going to go see the Tom Hanks movie tomorrow afternoon.</p>

I’m going to go teach some courses, and then I’m going to go work on some projects this afternoon, some articles that I’m working on.  I teach media and communications. I teach advertising. I teach public relations. I teach mass communications. And I write, I have to write. I have to publish this stuff. It is pretty much a good day. Every day is a good day.</p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I’m a morning person. I enjoy the mornings more. I like to take it easy in the morning and then work later on in the day. And I get more work done in the evening than I do in the morning. That’s just a habit I’ve had in life for a long time. I like to work late in the night. I usually stay in my office until after midnight most often. I like coming out in the morning, there aren’t many folks around. I come out of my office, there aren’t many folks around. I don’t have anything against people, I like people. But the kind of work I do, just by nature, I spend a lot of time alone. </p><p>It’s pretty solitary work. You’re either spending time reading other people’s works, that’s how you get to know people, is basically through their writing, or you’re spending time with your own thoughts. I think that’s almost a danger of the job, is that you spend too much time with your own thoughts.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Similar schedule.</p>

And I’m also on Pan American Organization, the translation committee, so half the day we’ll be in Manhattan, and then I’ll go to a meeting this evening. So half the day in Brooklyn, half the day in Manhattan. </p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>The morning. Always. I like the light, I like the cooler temperature if it’s a warmer season. It always seems hopeful. I have this big shoot of energy around 2:30, and then I come out of that and then I’m better in the early evening. </p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>I’m taking care of admin stuff today. So I’ll get back to poetry tomorrow. It’s best in the morning, writing poetry. I do believe in the idea that when you wake up, you’re still open to some other sort of dream world and everything that is still going on in your subconscious, so it’s an effective time to write. And you don’t listen to the radio or bring in the bad news before you start.</p>

So, I have to haul a lot of water in because I’m at an antique show and they need tender, loving care. I’m the plant lady at this show. I’ve been doing it for 20 years or more. So I have a lot of repeat customers. I’m known for my plants and other things. </p><p class='question'>Are you here all day?</p><p>Yeah, I’m here all week. I’ve been here since Saturday, setting up. I’m here until Saturday or Sunday. It depends on how much I sell and what the weather is like. I’m here for the duration. I never leave early. Nobody leaves from this field. Other fields, people will stay for a few hours or a day. We all stay. We’re very committed to everyone staying here. We have customers all week long.</p><p class='question'>What’s your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I just love it all. I absolutely do.</p><p>I’m happy when I wake up. I sleep here too. I sleep either in my van with my little dog, Ted. Or we sleep in a tent in the back. We’re very happy. We’re happy when we wake up. I make coffee. Fresh ground beans. I know how to travel. And I love seeing my customers. I have a lot of repeat customers, because I’ve been here so long. So I love seeing them again. It’s more than business, we hug. We talk about real things going on in our lives. It’s friendships over years. I’m happy all day long. By the end of the day, I’m happy to have a glass of wine and I have dinner with friends. We either do something here on the field or we go to a nearby restaurant.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Same thing. Same old, same old. You know, water the plants, take good care of them so that they look really good. Bag up some more potpourri. </p><p>You know, I’m constantly redecorating the booth, moving things around. This table has been there a while, move that, maybe move this over, change things on top of the tables. They look different placed in a different arrangement. </p><p>I love this booth because it has shrubbery around it and it kind of goes with my stuff. I’m really happy in this space. I tried other fields before finding this one, and I’m really happy here. And this is my gypsy family. We convene, we gather as a group. It’s very sad at the end of September Brim, because we won’t see each other until May. We keep in touch with email or Facebook, but it’s not like being together. I’m very fond of my neighbors. </p>

It’s an awful lot of work. So when you get tired and discouraged, you just have fun. You go to your neighbors, you steal some letters, you spell out some things. As long as it’s not too naughty. I don’t want to get kicked out of the field. But it’s a beautiful day. It’s gorgeous out. I people watch too while I’m here.</p><p>I don’t know how many years I’ve been coming here, you’ll have to ask one of these other folks. I shopped here 30 years ago. This might be year number six that I’ve actually set up here. </p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I like first thing in the morning. I get up at like 4.

I might do a little shopping tomorrow. Just in this field, this is the best field. It’s just comfortable, it’s easy going, not just straight rows of tents. I think this used to be a campsite. I get along with everybody in here. Everybody is pretty cool in this field. It’s only sometimes the patrons are fighting with each other. It’s entertainment. </p>

We just tell the public about the benefits of New York City water. Try to get them to use tap water instead of bottled water, to help preserve the environment, not waste so much plastic and money.

I like coming over here in the morning, I'm too old to enjoy the afternoon and evening nonsense.</p><p class='question'>What is your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I'd have to say, probably morning. Just because I'm an early person. I didn't like to get up and go to work, but I like to get up in the morning. I was a runner for a long time, and ran in the mornings. When my running was over, the best part of my day was over. </p><p>It's odd, most of my friends that are retired think I'm nuts. "Why don't you sleep late?" Well, sleeping late has never been something I want to do. So yeah, that's the favorite part.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Gee, I haven't thought that far ahead. I'm going away on Saturday, so I'm taking care of some things for that. I'm going up to Maine for a few days. Some shopping, seeing a friend, nothing very dramatic.</p>

It's just a lovely way to start the day. </p><p class='question'>Do you do this often?</p><p>As much as we can, yes.</p><p class='question'>Couple times a week? </p><p>It kind of depends. Once it starts getting warm, then it's not a good place for it. What I'll do on some mornings is, where I live it's a corner and the cross breeze is coming from two directions. So I'll just take, well not this chair, but a regular lawn chair and sit by the corner, by the apartment building, get the cross breeze, do that for an hour. Usually I read my newspaper. </p><p class='question'>So you're in a bigger apartment building?</p><p>Yes. </p><p class='question'>So you can't just sit out on the stoop or anything. </p><p>No, I don't have a stoop anymore. And I don't have a terrace, I would love a terrace. It's on the list of things I'd love to have.</p><p class='question'>And how long have you lived around here?</p><p>I don't live in the heart of Bay Ridge, I'm sort of on the border. But basically, I've lived here for 45 years. My grandparents lived a block from where I live now. All my life, basically. I actually grew up in Bensonhurst, on 14th avenue, right across the street from the golf course. </p><p class='question'>And who do you live with now? </p><p>My sister. </p><p class='question'>And what time did you wake up this morning? </p><p>6 o'clock. In the winter I sleep later and go to bed late. Go out when it's warmer.</p><p class='question'>What is your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I do like the early morning. I like the quiet of the early morning. When you can open the windows and listen to the birds. And then, again I like late nights. It's quiet. I like the quiet. </p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow it's supposed to rain, and I have a doctors appointment at 3 o'clock. </p>

I'm just sitting here waiting.</p><p class='question'>What time did you wake up?</p><p>At 6.</p><p class='question'>How did you get over here?</p><p>The F to the R, we met at Union Square and then walked up here.</p><p class='question'>What is your favorite part of the day?</p><p>Probably evening. Usually because I'm done with work. I just like the light, and it cools off in the summer. It's nicer then. Early morning is nice too. I like the less hot parts of the day.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow I'm off, so I don't know, we'll see. I don't have to work. I've been doing some time lapse photography with flowers. So I have one flower that will hopefully will open. I did it yesterday, and I had it in the air conditioned living room and it didn't open. The kitchen is near the highway so it shakes. And it had leaves, so I'm going to cut the leaves off so they won't move as much. And I need the sun and the warmth. There's no air conditioning in the kitchen so I think it will open up.</p><p class='question'>So it's that fast that you can do this in one day?</p><p>Well it depends on the flower. I tried a flower outside in my garden from 6:30 to 9:30, but my camera starting overheating and it barely moved. I picked this dahlia and it's just really slow to open. Some I think will open. We'll see, I just started. This is my second flower. Hopefully I'll get some good stuff. I'm getting that flicker problem. Have you done time lapse before?</p><p class='question'>Not really. Is it shaking?</p><p>It's not that it's shaking, it's the light changing. It reads like a flicker. I did one minute intervals yesterday, for about 7 or 8 hours. I kept it on the same exposure. The first time I did it — I just started doing these and if you change the shutter, I was changing to shutter to change exposure which was a big mistake. That was the first time I did it though. And I didn't do any research, it was kind of stupid. I just read how to use the intervalometer. But anyway, yesterday everything was consistent. I think the intervals are too long though so it fluctuates and it reads like a flicker. But it looked kind of cool. Even though nothing moved, the flower kind of breathed and went up and came back down. So yeah, I'm going to do that tomorrow. </p>

I start work at 10 on 27th street So I biked down this morning. </p><p class='question'>What do you do?</p><p>I'm an acupuncturist. I've been doing it for seven years. I broke my back when I was 21 and that was the only thing that helped. I didn't end up getting surgery, but that was the only thing that was able to get the pain to go away. I was going to be a doctor before that, but after acupuncture worked, I was like "fuck this shit, this is cool, I gotta learn how to do acupuncture so I can help people."</p><p class='question'>So it was that effective that you went and did it yourself.</p><p>Yeah. Well, a lot of times in medicine, they're like, "hey, let's see." It's someone listening to your problems, if something works even a little bit, it's a huge progress in the right direction.</p><p class='question'>Do you enjoy it?</p><p>I love it.

And then the 15 minutes before I go to sleep. It's peaceful. In the morning I get to set up the intention of how the whole day is going to go and what I want to create. And at night it's nice to reflect on it and see what worked and what didn't.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow, I have another office up in Westchester so I'll wake up early and drive up there.</p><p class='question'>You're not biking up there?</p><p>No, but one of these days I'm going to. It's only like 26 miles and there's a path. I'm in Mount Kisco so you can take the bike path all the way up the Saw Mill. They just don't have a shower up there, so it's been way to hot to just show up and start talking to people all sweaty. There's been days that have been bad. The A/C broke a couple weeks ago and I'm like blotting myself off with paper towels. </p>
