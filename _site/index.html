It’s similar to the one that they’ve got in France. The bridge where you throw away the key to symbolize everlasting love.</p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>Well the helicopter ride was the best. We got to see everything from there. We got a bit of an idea of the layout. Times Square is pretty breathtaking. Quite intense. </p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>I think we’re going to do the Empire State Building tomorrow. And then just some shopping on 5th Avenue. We’re here for 6 days. </p>

      		<p class='question'>What are you doing today?</p><p>I had breakfast already, in the park here. And now after I finish doing this crossword puzzle and the rest of the paper, I’ll go and get another paper and do the crossword puzzle. Then I’m going to take a long walk into Williamsburg.</p><p>I’m new to this area, so I like to walk, and walk, and walk. I’ll take a three hour walk this afternoon. I’m looking for something. I walked by it one day. On any one of the streets, just between Kent and Bedford. And, I came by a little theater that looked interesting, but I didn’t note it. So now I’m searching the streets. I’ve got to go find it. I started yesterday, did about three hours, walking around and I still have about eight more streets to do there. It looked like it was very small. So I want to catch that and see what their schedule is, and what they have there. </p><p>I moved from Manhattan. Actually, I’ll tell you the whole story. I used to live on 36th St. And the guy, I knew he was having problems with the building, it was a five story walkup. And he kept on renovating the building, and not reporting it to the proper people. He’d be selling it to members of his family, so he’d have to start all over again.  So, finally the judge got fed up, told the Buildings Department and the Fire Department, go over there and if it’s illegal, shut it down. Out of about twenty apartments, there was only one legal apartment. And the fireman said to me, “it’s not yours.” So the Red Cross put us up in a hotel for two days and now I’m living at the Y, trying to save enough money to get an apartment. But hey, a lot of people have it worse than me. </p><p>I like this neighborhood, and I don’t think I can afford Manhattan anymore. So I’ve got to wait another couple of weeks, save some more money, and go to a real estate agent. I’ve gone to a couple to get an idea, and if I can’t find anything here, my niece lives in Astoria. She says “Uncle Frank, we’ve got plenty of room over here.” I used to go out with a girl there, so I know the area. I’ve hung out in it, what have you. </p><p>But here I like it. If I had all my stuff with me, I’d be working out for two hours in the morning. Jogging, pushups against the bench, I have these weights that I walk with and jog with. So I like to be near McCarren Park. There are other small parks, but the thing that keeps me going, like when I lived on the west side of Manhattan, I’d go up the river one time, and down the river the next day. It keeps you going. Here I can go around different trails and they’ve got the track over there. </p><p>That’s my story.</p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>In the late afternoon, when I sit down and have a few beers with some people around here. I’ve only been here six weeks and I’m already treated like family by a lot of people. I like the people here. </p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>If I don’t find that today, I’m going to repeat it again until I find it. But I think I’ll find it today. If not, I’m going to go see the Tom Hanks movie tomorrow afternoon.</p>

So, I’m walking all the way across the Williamsburg Bridge. I really have no plans. I’m choosing to not hang out with people and just kind of see where the day goes.</p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>My favorite part of the day is morning, definitely. It’s kind of quiet and cozy. People are just getting going, so it’s a good time to think and walk and look.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Well tonight I’m actually headed up to Cape Cod with friends from the city. We’re going to go up there for a few days. I live in Northern Michigan, Traverse City. I was in the city for ten years, and then after 9/11 I just wanted to go settle elsewhere. So I did! </p>

Every day is a good day.</p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I’m a morning person. I enjoy the mornings more. I like to take it easy in the morning and then work later on in the day. And I get more work done in the evening than I do in the morning. That’s just a habit I’ve had in life for a long time. I like to work late in the night. I usually stay in my office until after midnight most often. I like coming out in the morning, there aren’t many folks around. I come out of my office, there aren’t many folks around. I don’t have anything against people, I like people. But the kind of work I do, just by nature, I spend a lot of time alone. </p><p>It’s pretty solitary work. You’re either spending time reading other people’s works, that’s how you get to know people, is basically through their writing, or you’re spending time with your own thoughts. I think that’s almost a danger of the job, is that you spend too much time with your own thoughts.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Similar schedule.</p>

And I’m also on Pan American Organization, the translation committee, so half the day we’ll be in Manhattan, and then I’ll go to a meeting this evening. So half the day in Brooklyn, half the day in Manhattan. </p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>The morning. Always. I like the light, I like the cooler temperature if it’s a warmer season. It always seems hopeful. I have this big shoot of energy around 2:30, and then I come out of that and then I’m better in the early evening. </p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>I’m taking care of admin stuff today. So I’ll get back to poetry tomorrow. It’s best in the morning, writing poetry. I do believe in the idea that when you wake up, you’re still open to some other sort of dream world and everything that is still going on in your subconscious, so it’s an effective time to write. And you don’t listen to the radio or bring in the bad news before you start.</p>

So, I have to haul a lot of water in because I’m at an antique show and they need tender, loving care. I’m the plant lady at this show. I’ve been doing it for 20 years or more. So I have a lot of repeat customers. I’m known for my plants and other things. </p><p class='question'>Are you here all day?</p><p>Yeah, I’m here all week. I’ve been here since Saturday, setting up. I’m here until Saturday or Sunday. It depends on how much I sell and what the weather is like. I’m here for the duration. I never leave early. Nobody leaves from this field. Other fields, people will stay for a few hours or a day. We all stay. We’re very committed to everyone staying here. We have customers all week long.</p><p class='question'>What’s your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I just love it all. I absolutely do.</p><p>I’m happy when I wake up. I sleep here too. I sleep either in my van with my little dog, Ted. Or we sleep in a tent in the back. We’re very happy. We’re happy when we wake up. I make coffee. Fresh ground beans. I know how to travel. And I love seeing my customers. I have a lot of repeat customers, because I’ve been here so long. So I love seeing them again. It’s more than business, we hug. We talk about real things going on in our lives. It’s friendships over years. I’m happy all day long. By the end of the day, I’m happy to have a glass of wine and I have dinner with friends. We either do something here on the field or we go to a nearby restaurant.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Same thing. Same old, same old. You know, water the plants, take good care of them so that they look really good. Bag up some more potpourri. </p><p>You know, I’m constantly redecorating the booth, moving things around. This table has been there a while, move that, maybe move this over, change things on top of the tables. They look different placed in a different arrangement. </p><p>I love this booth because it has shrubbery around it and it kind of goes with my stuff. I’m really happy in this space. I tried other fields before finding this one, and I’m really happy here. And this is my gypsy family. We convene, we gather as a group. It’s very sad at the end of September Brim, because we won’t see each other until May. We keep in touch with email or Facebook, but it’s not like being together. I’m very fond of my neighbors. </p>

It’s an awful lot of work. So when you get tired and discouraged, you just have fun. You go to your neighbors, you steal some letters, you spell out some things. As long as it’s not too naughty. I don’t want to get kicked out of the field. But it’s a beautiful day. It’s gorgeous out. I people watch too while I’m here.</p><p>I don’t know how many years I’ve been coming here, you’ll have to ask one of these other folks. I shopped here 30 years ago. This might be year number six that I’ve actually set up here. </p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I like first thing in the morning. I get up at like 4. Nobody else is up, it’s quiet, it’s dark. I have my coffee and I can take my time to set up and do my thing. </p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Same thing. I might do a little shopping tomorrow. Just in this field, this is the best field. It’s just comfortable, it’s easy going, not just straight rows of tents. I think this used to be a campsite. I get along with everybody in here. Everybody is pretty cool in this field. It’s only sometimes the patrons are fighting with each other. It’s entertainment. </p>

Especially living in the New York, the tap water is so great. </p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I’d like to say the end of the day, because it gets kind of tiring standing out here for about seven or eight hours a day lecturing people. It has it’s perks, but the end of the work day is definitely my favorite.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow I’m working at Union Square. I’ll be there around 9:30. And at night I have  a birthday party to go to up in Queens at a hookah lounge. So, that should be fun.</p>

I like coming over here in the morning, I'm too old to enjoy the afternoon and evening nonsense.</p><p class='question'>What is your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I'd have to say, probably morning. Just because I'm an early person. I didn't like to get up and go to work, but I like to get up in the morning. I was a runner for a long time, and ran in the mornings. When my running was over, the best part of my day was over. </p><p>It's odd, most of my friends that are retired think I'm nuts. "Why don't you sleep late?" Well, sleeping late has never been something I want to do. So yeah, that's the favorite part.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Gee, I haven't thought that far ahead. I'm going away on Saturday, so I'm taking care of some things for that. I'm going up to Maine for a few days. Some shopping, seeing a friend, nothing very dramatic.</p>

It's just a lovely way to start the day. </p><p class='question'>Do you do this often?</p><p>As much as we can, yes.</p><p class='question'>Couple times a week? </p><p>It kind of depends. Once it starts getting warm, then it's not a good place for it. What I'll do on some mornings is, where I live it's a corner and the cross breeze is coming from two directions. So I'll just take, well not this chair, but a regular lawn chair and sit by the corner, by the apartment building, get the cross breeze, do that for an hour. Usually I read my newspaper. </p><p class='question'>So you're in a bigger apartment building?</p><p>Yes. </p><p class='question'>So you can't just sit out on the stoop or anything. </p><p>No, I don't have a stoop anymore. And I don't have a terrace, I would love a terrace. It's on the list of things I'd love to have.</p><p class='question'>And how long have you lived around here?</p><p>I don't live in the heart of Bay Ridge, I'm sort of on the border. But basically, I've lived here for 45 years. My grandparents lived a block from where I live now. All my life, basically. I actually grew up in Bensonhurst, on 14th avenue, right across the street from the golf course. </p><p class='question'>And who do you live with now? </p><p>My sister. </p><p class='question'>And what time did you wake up this morning? </p><p>6 o'clock. In the winter I sleep later and go to bed late. Go out when it's warmer.</p><p class='question'>What is your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I do like the early morning. I like the quiet of the early morning. When you can open the windows and listen to the birds. And then, again I like late nights. It's quiet. I like the quiet. </p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow it's supposed to rain, and I have a doctors appointment at 3 o'clock. </p>

The director goes to New York Film Academy and he's waiting for the actor, who's over an hour late.</p><p>This doesn't usually happen. He's probably panicking more than me though. I'm just sitting here waiting.</p><p class='question'>What time did you wake up?</p><p>At 6.</p><p class='question'>How did you get over here?</p><p>The F to the R, we met at Union Square and then walked up here.</p><p class='question'>What is your favorite part of the day?</p><p>Probably evening. Usually because I'm done with work. I just like the light, and it cools off in the summer. It's nicer then. Early morning is nice too. I like the less hot parts of the day.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow I'm off, so I don't know, we'll see. I don't have to work. I've been doing some time lapse photography with flowers. So I have one flower that will hopefully will open. I did it yesterday, and I had it in the air conditioned living room and it didn't open. The kitchen is near the highway so it shakes. And it had leaves, so I'm going to cut the leaves off so they won't move as much. And I need the sun and the warmth. There's no air conditioning in the kitchen so I think it will open up.</p><p class='question'>So it's that fast that you can do this in one day?</p><p>Well it depends on the flower. I tried a flower outside in my garden from 6:30 to 9:30, but my camera starting overheating and it barely moved. I picked this dahlia and it's just really slow to open. Some I think will open. We'll see, I just started. This is my second flower. Hopefully I'll get some good stuff. I'm getting that flicker problem. Have you done time lapse before?</p><p class='question'>Not really. Is it shaking?</p><p>It's not that it's shaking, it's the light changing. It reads like a flicker. I did one minute intervals yesterday, for about 7 or 8 hours. I kept it on the same exposure. The first time I did it — I just started doing these and if you change the shutter, I was changing to shutter to change exposure which was a big mistake. That was the first time I did it though. And I didn't do any research, it was kind of stupid. I just read how to use the intervalometer. But anyway, yesterday everything was consistent. I think the intervals are too long though so it fluctuates and it reads like a flicker. But it looked kind of cool. Even though nothing moved, the flower kind of breathed and went up and came back down. So yeah, I'm going to do that tomorrow. </p>

I start work at 10 on 27th street So I biked down this morning. </p><p class='question'>What do you do?</p><p>I'm an acupuncturist. I've been doing it for seven years. I broke my back when I was 21 and that was the only thing that helped. I didn't end up getting surgery, but that was the only thing that was able to get the pain to go away. I was going to be a doctor before that, but after acupuncture worked, I was like "fuck this shit, this is cool, I gotta learn how to do acupuncture so I can help people."</p><p class='question'>So it was that effective that you went and did it yourself.</p><p>Yeah. Well, a lot of times in medicine, they're like, "hey, let's see." It's someone listening to your problems, if something works even a little bit, it's a huge progress in the right direction.</p><p class='question'>Do you enjoy it?</p><p>I love it. It's a lot of work sometimes. </p><p>I've been around Chelsea for the whole time. I've been in the office I'm at for four years now.

And then the 15 minutes before I go to sleep. It's peaceful. In the morning I get to set up the intention of how the whole day is going to go and what I want to create. And at night it's nice to reflect on it and see what worked and what didn't.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow, I have another office up in Westchester so I'll wake up early and drive up there.</p><p class='question'>You're not biking up there?</p><p>No, but one of these days I'm going to. It's only like 26 miles and there's a path. I'm in Mount Kisco so you can take the bike path all the way up the Saw Mill. They just don't have a shower up there, so it's been way to hot to just show up and start talking to people all sweaty. There's been days that have been bad. The A/C broke a couple weeks ago and I'm like blotting myself off with paper towels. </p>
