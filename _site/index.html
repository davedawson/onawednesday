I'll be here until around 12:20 - 12:30. I've been here for two weeks straight.</p><p>I work general field, so I could be anywhere. I could be at a station, giving information on how to get to your destination, or I can be riding on the bus, doing a ride check. So I could be doing anything.</p><p class='question'>What’s your favorite part of the day?</p><p>Getting off. I actually work two jobs, so I leave here and go to another one. Everyday I work two jobs besides Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Because Thursday and Friday are my days off with the MTA, and then I'm a custodian at PS179 and my days off are Friday, Saturday there. I need to rest at least two or three hours in a day. Sometimes I'm just tired. </p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow I'll be working as a custodian. Just a custodian tomorrow. But Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, it's pretty competitive with the two jobs. </p>

Hope this will help me out in the future, getting a permanent job at the DEP. </p><p>This is a summer internship. I started in early May and it will end around mid-August. </p><p>My job entails coming to one of these fountains at a certain location, usually at Brooklyn Bridge, City Hall, or Union Square. We just tell the public about the benefits of New York City water. Try to get them to use tap water instead of bottled water, to help preserve the environment, not waste so much plastic and money. Especially living in the New York, the tap water is so great. </p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I’d like to say the end of the day, because it gets kind of tiring standing out here for about seven or eight hours a day lecturing people. It has it’s perks, but the end of the work day is definitely my favorite.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow I’m working at Union Square. I’ll be there around 9:30. And at night I have  a birthday party to go to up in Queens at a hookah lounge. So, that should be fun.</p>

Right now I'm sitting in the park reading my paper. I do that every morning.</p><p>This is my backyard. I live two blocks away, over on Waverly and I love living in New York. I love it. I don't know why anybody would want to live anywhere else. Well, that's a little extreme. This is like my backyard. I like coming over here in the morning, I'm too old to enjoy the afternoon and evening nonsense.</p><p class='question'>What is your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I'd have to say, probably morning. Just because I'm an early person. I didn't like to get up and go to work, but I like to get up in the morning. I was a runner for a long time, and ran in the mornings. When my running was over, the best part of my day was over. </p><p>It's odd, most of my friends that are retired think I'm nuts. "Why don't you sleep late?" Well, sleeping late has never been something I want to do. So yeah, that's the favorite part.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Gee, I haven't thought that far ahead. I'm going away on Saturday, so I'm taking care of some things for that. I'm going up to Maine for a few days. Some shopping, seeing a friend, nothing very dramatic.</p>

It's just a lovely way to start the day. </p><p class='question'>Do you do this often?</p><p>As much as we can, yes.</p><p class='question'>Couple times a week? </p><p>It kind of depends. Once it starts getting warm, then it's not a good place for it. What I'll do on some mornings is, where I live it's a corner and the cross breeze is coming from two directions. So I'll just take, well not this chair, but a regular lawn chair and sit by the corner, by the apartment building, get the cross breeze, do that for an hour. Usually I read my newspaper. </p><p class='question'>So you're in a bigger apartment building?</p><p>Yes. </p><p class='question'>So you can't just sit out on the stoop or anything. </p><p>No, I don't have a stoop anymore. And I don't have a terrace, I would love a terrace. It's on the list of things I'd love to have.</p><p class='question'>And how long have you lived around here?</p><p>I don't live in the heart of Bay Ridge, I'm sort of on the border. But basically, I've lived here for 45 years. My grandparents lived a block from where I live now. All my life, basically. I actually grew up in Bensonhurst, on 14th avenue, right across the street from the golf course. </p><p class='question'>And who do you live with now? </p><p>My sister. </p><p class='question'>And what time did you wake up this morning? </p><p>6 o'clock. In the winter I sleep later and go to bed late. Go out when it's warmer.</p><p class='question'>What is your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I do like the early morning. I like the quiet of the early morning. When you can open the windows and listen to the birds. And then, again I like late nights. It's quiet. I like the quiet. </p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow it's supposed to rain, and I have a doctors appointment at 3 o'clock. </p>

      	<div class="interview">
      		<p class='question'>What are you doing today?</p><p>I'm shooting a student film, but the actor hasn't shown up yet. So these are some of the guys on the project. The director goes to New York Film Academy and he's waiting for the actor, who's over an hour late.</p><p>This doesn't usually happen. He's probably panicking more than me though. I'm just sitting here waiting.</p><p class='question'>What time did you wake up?</p><p>At 6.</p><p class='question'>How did you get over here?</p><p>The F to the R, we met at Union Square and then walked up here.</p><p class='question'>What is your favorite part of the day?</p><p>Probably evening. Usually because I'm done with work. I just like the light, and it cools off in the summer. It's nicer then. Early morning is nice too. I like the less hot parts of the day.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow I'm off, so I don't know, we'll see. I don't have to work. I've been doing some time lapse photography with flowers. So I have one flower that will hopefully will open. I did it yesterday, and I had it in the air conditioned living room and it didn't open. The kitchen is near the highway so it shakes. And it had leaves, so I'm going to cut the leaves off so they won't move as much. And I need the sun and the warmth. There's no air conditioning in the kitchen so I think it will open up.</p><p class='question'>So it's that fast that you can do this in one day?</p><p>Well it depends on the flower. I tried a flower outside in my garden from 6:30 to 9:30, but my camera starting overheating and it barely moved. I picked this dahlia and it's just really slow to open. Some I think will open. We'll see, I just started. This is my second flower. Hopefully I'll get some good stuff. I'm getting that flicker problem. Have you done time lapse before?</p><p class='question'>Not really. Is it shaking?</p><p>It's not that it's shaking, it's the light changing. It reads like a flicker. I did one minute intervals yesterday, for about 7 or 8 hours. I kept it on the same exposure. The first time I did it — I just started doing these and if you change the shutter, I was changing to shutter to change exposure which was a big mistake. That was the first time I did it though. And I didn't do any research, it was kind of stupid. I just read how to use the intervalometer. But anyway, yesterday everything was consistent. I think the intervals are too long though so it fluctuates and it reads like a flicker. But it looked kind of cool. Even though nothing moved, the flower kind of breathed and went up and came back down. So yeah, I'm going to do that tomorrow. </p>

      	<div class="interview">
      		<p class='question'>What are you doing today?</p><p>Just hanging out here for a couple of minutes. I start work at 10 on 27th street So I biked down this morning. </p><p class='question'>What do you do?</p><p>I'm an acupuncturist. I've been doing it for seven years. I broke my back when I was 21 and that was the only thing that helped. I didn't end up getting surgery, but that was the only thing that was able to get the pain to go away. I was going to be a doctor before that, but after acupuncture worked, I was like "fuck this shit, this is cool, I gotta learn how to do acupuncture so I can help people."</p><p class='question'>So it was that effective that you went and did it yourself.</p><p>Yeah. Well, a lot of times in medicine, they're like, "hey, let's see." It's someone listening to your problems, if something works even a little bit, it's a huge progress in the right direction.</p><p class='question'>Do you enjoy it?</p><p>I love it. It's a lot of work sometimes. </p><p>I've been around Chelsea for the whole time. I've been in the office I'm at for four years now. But I'm moving in a couple of weeks. </p><p class='question'>What time did you wake up this morning?</p><p>6am</p><p class='question'>Do you live by yourself?</p><p>I live with my fiancée.</p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I think the morning. And then the 15 minutes before I go to sleep. It's peaceful. In the morning I get to set up the intention of how the whole day is going to go and what I want to create. And at night it's nice to reflect on it and see what worked and what didn't.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow, I have another office up in Westchester so I'll wake up early and drive up there.</p><p class='question'>You're not biking up there?</p><p>No, but one of these days I'm going to. It's only like 26 miles and there's a path. I'm in Mount Kisco so you can take the bike path all the way up the Saw Mill. They just don't have a shower up there, so it's been way to hot to just show up and start talking to people all sweaty. There's been days that have been bad. The A/C broke a couple weeks ago and I'm like blotting myself off with paper towels. </p>
