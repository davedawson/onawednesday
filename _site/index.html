It's a French guy and they just started opening a new store and it's really, really good. I got bread and a raspberry financier.</p><p class='question'>Is that all you have planned today?</p><p>Well, it's very private. But actually, I took the day off because I'm pregnant and I have a big doctor appointment, so I just didn't want to rush from work.</p><p class='question'>Congratulations! That's really exciting. And what time did you wake up today?</p><p>Like 7.</p><p class='question'>And what is your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I have an almost two year old son, so it's when I pick him up at daycare. He is all happy and I am happy too.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Back to work. It's not so fun.</p>

      	<div class="interview">
      		<p class='question'>What are you doing today?</p><p>I'm shooting a student film, but the actor hasn't shown up yet. So these are some of the guys on the project. The director goes to New York Film Academy and he's waiting for the actor, who's over an hour late.</p><p>This doesn't usually happen. He's probably panicking more than me though. I'm just sitting here waiting.</p><p class='question'>What time did you wake up?</p><p>At 6.</p><p class='question'>How did you get over here?</p><p>The F to the R, we met at Union Square and then walked up here.</p><p class='question'>What is your favorite part of the day?</p><p>Probably evening. Usually because I'm done with work. I just like the light, and it cools off in the summer. It's nicer then. Early morning is nice too. I like the less hot parts of the day.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow I'm off, so I don't know, we'll see. I don't have to work. I've been doing some time lapse photography with flowers. So I have one flower that will hopefully will open. I did it yesterday, and I had it in the air conditioned living room and it didn't open. The kitchen is near the highway so it shakes. And it had leaves, so I'm going to cut the leaves off so they won't move as much. And I need the sun and the warmth. There's no air conditioning in the kitchen so I think it will open up.</p><p class='question'>So it's that fast that you can do this in one day?</p><p>Well it depends on the flower. I tried a flower outside in my garden from 6:30 to 9:30, but my camera starting overheating and it barely moved. I picked this dahlia and it's just really slow to open. Some I think will open. We'll see, I just started. This is my second flower. Hopefully I'll get some good stuff. I'm getting that flicker problem. Have you done time lapse before?</p><p class='question'>Not really. Is it shaking?</p><p>It's not that it's shaking, it's the light changing. It reads like a flicker. I did one minute intervals yesterday, for about 7 or 8 hours. I kept it on the same exposure. The first time I did it — I just started doing these and if you change the shutter, I was changing to shutter to change exposure which was a big mistake. That was the first time I did it though. And I didn't do any research, it was kind of stupid. I just read how to use the intervalometer. But anyway, yesterday everything was consistent. I think the intervals are too long though so it fluctuates and it reads like a flicker. But it looked kind of cool. Even though nothing moved, the flower kind of breathed and went up and came back down. So yeah, I'm going to do that tomorrow. </p>

      		<p class='question'>What are you doing today?</p><p>Just hanging out here for a couple of minutes. I start work at 10 on 27th street So I biked down this morning. </p><p class='question'>What do you do?</p><p>I'm an acupuncturist. I've been doing it for seven years. I broke my back when I was 21 and that was the only thing that helped. I didn't end up getting surgery, but that was the only thing that was able to get the pain to go away. I was going to be a doctor before that, but after acupuncture worked, I was like "fuck this shit, this is cool, I gotta learn how to do acupuncture so I can help people."</p><p class='question'>So it was that effective that you went and did it yourself.</p><p>Yeah. Well, a lot of times in medicine, they're like, "hey, let's see." It's someone listening to your problems, if something works even a little bit, it's a huge progress in the right direction.</p><p class='question'>Do you enjoy it?</p><p>I love it. It's a lot of work sometimes. </p><p>I've been around Chelsea for the whole time. I've been in the office I'm at for four years now. But I'm moving in a couple of weeks. </p><p class='question'>What time did you wake up this morning?</p><p>6am</p><p class='question'>Do you live by yourself?</p><p>I live with my fiancée.</p><p class='question'>What's your favorite part of the day?</p><p>I think the morning. And then the 15 minutes before I go to sleep. It's peaceful. In the morning I get to set up the intention of how the whole day is going to go and what I want to create. And at night it's nice to reflect on it and see what worked and what didn't.</p><p class='question'>What are you doing tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow, I have another office up in Westchester so I'll wake up early and drive up there.</p><p class='question'>You're not biking up there?</p><p>No, but one of these days I'm going to. It's only like 26 miles and there's a path. I'm in Mount Kisco so you can take the bike path all the way up the Saw Mill. They just don't have a shower up there, so it's been way to hot to just show up and start talking to people all sweaty. There's been days that have been bad. The A/C broke a couple weeks ago and I'm like blotting myself off with paper towels. </p>
