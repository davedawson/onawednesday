<div class="interview">
	<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Today I came down to see Verizon about my phone. Somehow, my phone was going straight to voicemail. But I had it on airplane mode. I was telling the guy down there, knowledge is key. I didn’t bother to look at the settings and check airplane mode. Now I now. I learned something today. Later I’ll probably go pick my friend up from work and take him home. </p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>The morning, becuse I woke up. A lot of my friends, with the lifestyle I’ve lived are not here today. I am truly grateful for waking up. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>I’m not sure. My schedule is that open. I’m definitely looking forward to it. I may jump in the van to help someone move tomorrow. </p>

<p class="question">Hopefully it’s not too nasty out tomorrow</p>

<p>This doesn’t bother me. I’ve been through 66 of these things. Come on. I can’t understand the big uproar about the weather. But it’s always been a topic for conversation. In the Northeast, you’ve got to expect this. You think the people in Boston are complaining? This is not bad. The subways are out, people are all confused and discombobulated. Look at the street though, I fail to see the confusion. </p>
