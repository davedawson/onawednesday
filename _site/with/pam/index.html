<div class="interview">
	<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>We’re here to buy. We’ve been coming here for almost twenty years and I’m here with my daughter. She’s eleven now and she’s been coming here since she was in me, so it’s a family tradition. We took her out of school, but we felt like this was a really good education. That’s why we come.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>The reason why I’m standing right here, is that I’m waiting for a friend and she has a son, he's five and his name is Crosby. He is so precious. He’s only allowed to have ice cream once a year. That once a year is here in Brimfield. Today is the big day. I’m waiting to meet up with them so I can watch him enjoy his once a year ice cream. That’s why I’m standing right in the middle of Heart of the Mart.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>We’re supposed to leave today. I called the school and told them that she wasn’t going to be there. But I’m hoping that my husband is like “Well, we’re having such a nice time,” because he’s here the whole week. We came in separate cars. So I’m like, maybe I’ll just take her out of school for the whole week. So that’s kind of on the burner, otherwise we’ll have to leave.</p>
