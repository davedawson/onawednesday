<div class="interview">
	<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I worked today. I came in at 5 in the morning, got my guys out by 7 and did a couple of estimates. I have to go home because I have a few estimates done at my house. I’m having some stuff done to my yard. Other than that, I stop and eat wherever I want and run my business. Not much to my life, it’s pretty boring now. If you’d asked me fifteen years ago, it would have been a different story.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Seeing my kids. I know that’s not interesting, but that’s my favorite, going home to my kids at the end of the day. My favorite part during the day is just being out and about. I get to visit my customers, do estimates, new prospects, just being out and about everywhere. I’m in Manhattan two days a week, Brooklyn two days a week, Queens, Staten Island, I’m everywhere. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will be doing pretty much the same thing, but I’ll be training two of my guys. It’s termite season now, so I’ll be training two of my guys to do termite work, drilling and that stuff.</p>
