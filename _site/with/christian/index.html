<div class="interview">
	<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Today we are doing a bunch of different things. We are going to teach some kids how to play chess, how to play chess better. We are going to have an adult commercial chess league later on today that we’re preparing for. And, I will be leaving very shortly to train some of my star trophy winning chess champions in Queens to prepare for the national tournament. So it’s a full day.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>My favorite part of the day is waking up and strategizing what it is that I want to get accomplished and how I’m going to do it. That’s really my favorite part of the day. It’s like a piece of paper, when you haven’t put anything on it yet. So the possibilities and your imagination run wild, and you’re thinking about all the cool things that you can write or draw or color. That’s basically how I see the day, until I get into it. Then it all changes. . </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Thursday. Actually tomorrow is a little bit quieter. We have the after-school program, so we’ll be teaching chess to some kids tomorrow afternoon. We won’t be training, we’ll be working with kids who come here after school. We’ll be trying to get them to learn some better strategy and build their self-esteem a lot through chess. The kids that come on Thursday, there are two different groups. We have a very competitive, strong, strategic group of kids. Then we have the beginners, who are still trying to manage staying and paying attention. So Ms. Jillian is one of our best younger teachers. So, she kind of sits with them, but she’s new. So tomorrow we’ll be spending some time just making sure things that she needs to do and watching the kids learn.</p>
