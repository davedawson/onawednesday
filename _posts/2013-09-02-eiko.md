<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Just hanging around, it’s a nice day. Just walked from home here, and I was going to walk over the little swinging bridge, but it’s closed. Usually I don’t come around here. Usually I go Pier 6. I think they’re working on the bridge, maybe it’s too swingy.</p>

<p class="question">What is your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Late afternoon. Right before dinner, it’s not so cold, it’s not so hot.  </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow will be a nice day too, so I might be out for a little bit. I usually go to the gym, but today was a nice day so I wanted to enjoy it.</p>
