<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Right now I’m making mini-wreaths for a customer. I’ve just been doing some crafts. I’m not selling many trees, so I’m just making a few things. I start at 5 a.m. and try to go to bed around 9 p.m. It’s just for one month.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Between 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m., I get the sun right there. That’s my favorite part.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Same thing.</p>
