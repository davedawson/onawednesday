<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m doing some work. I just came from TechCrunch Disrupt, which is a technology conference. I do public relations for startups. I’m chasing a few interviews for my clients.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Twilight. When the sun is setting, I know that my work is about to be done and I can relax a bit.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>What’s tomorrow? Thursday? I don’t have a full work day tomorrow. This conference ends today. So I’ll still be working, I freelance from home, but I won’t be working as hard as today. I’ll probably be sitting back out here, but minus the laptop.</p>
