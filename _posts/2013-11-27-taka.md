<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I'm visiting the famous spots in NY today. I'm from Tokyo on a trip alone for the first time. </p>

<p>Today is the 4th day but the last day of my trip. Since it's sunny, I enjoyed the scapes of SOHO, and I've come here, the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Any time with plenty of sunlight. I love drinking coffee with views of Central park and Danvo in the Sun.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>I'm going to leave NY at 10:30 a.m. for Tokyo. I've been so excited and inspired by NY and New Yorkers so far. This visiting makes me feel like challenging everything everyday for the rest of my life. I wonder if I'll have another chance to come to NY again and work in in the future.</p>
