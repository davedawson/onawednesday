<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m going to the V.A. for an appointment. I have an appointment because I’m ex-military and a purple heart and I lost two toes. So I’m going to the V.A. and I’m going to let them take a look. </p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>I would say the morning. You never know what to expect in New York City. Usually the unexpected comes in the morning. I think it’s because New York is moving so fast, and I believe that the best laid plans get thwarted by New York City in the morning. So you have to revamp, rethink and reschedule. In the morning, I like the hecticness of it. It keeps you on your toes, even if you only have eight.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will probably clean the snow off the roof. It’s supposed to be warm tomorrow, and dry.</p>
