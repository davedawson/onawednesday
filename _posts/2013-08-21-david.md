<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Hanging out in the park and enjoying the weather. People watching, actually. Meeting friends later, and then getting some work done this afternoon.
</p>

<p class="question">What is your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Probably dinner. We know we're together for dinner, always. That's when we recap the day. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I have an interview. So I'll be prepping for that all morning.</p>
