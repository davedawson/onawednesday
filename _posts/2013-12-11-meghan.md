<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m decorating a Christmas tree stand that I’m working at. I’ll decorate the shopping cart that we deliver trees in. Mostly decorating before the rain comes. Opening trees, sweeping, there’s probably more on the list. It’s just a big list of really random Christmas tree stuff.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Probably when I wake up at 6 in the morning. It’s all quiet and no one is around for an hour. I get to sit, drink coffee and think for a second. That’s my favorite part.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Same things, probably. Maybe more stuff geared towards the weekend. It’s probably going to be the biggest weekend. We’ll have all sorts of varieties of trees out. It’s going to be nuts, in a good way.</p>

<p>I work from like 6 in the morning until 11 at night. Then the night guy comes and stays up all night for us. It’s a pretty intense month, but it’s good.</p>
