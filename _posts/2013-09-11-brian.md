<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Lunch break. Yep, work and lunch. I work for the courts system.</p>

<p class="question">What is your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>This right here.</p>
<p>Going home.</p>
<p>Going home first, this is second. Because leaving the city for the suburbs or Staten Island is more my style than being here in the city and working in Downtown Brooklyn. So this is a nice escape here.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Probably the same thing. Going to work, coming down here if itâ€™s nice out.</p>
