<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I came down to RadioShack to exchange something that I bought that wasn’t working too well. They gave me back my money. </p>

<p>I’ll probably be back in the studio later. I did two songs for my job. I work at Brooklyn Hospital. I’ve been there for 33 years. I have a big song called TBHC, Keep Brooklyn Healthy, letting everyone know how to get to the hospital, where and how to get there. And also about our E.R. nurses, what they do for you when you come there and how you feel. So I’ll be in the studio later trying finish those up.
</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>I’d probably say around afternoon. I usually get off around 2. Working in the emergency room it gets a little crazy. Putting out supplies and materials all day long and trauma and everything else going on. But I would say when I get off, I relax a little bit.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>I’ll actually be going going to work tomorrow and then cooling off for the rest of the day. I’m off next Monday, so I have a couple days off. </p>
