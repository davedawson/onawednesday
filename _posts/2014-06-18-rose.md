<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I think I’m going to bike into Williamsburg and Bushwick. I’m going to head out there tonight to do some street art, so I wanted to scope out a few spots. I’m a printmaker. I do silkscreening, so I made some posters. I’m from San Francisco, just out here for a few weeks. I just picked up my friend’s bike this morning. I biked over here and I’m scoping out the best way to get over there. I might do the bridge and go into Manhattan, but I might just explore those neighborhoods by bike. I brought my lunch and I’m just sort of ready for an adventure. </p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>I love mornings. The potential, the energy of the mornings. I have really good energy in the mornings. I feel really up and ready to go. And then I also really like warm nights. That’s the best, it’s really invigorating. You don’t really get that in San Francisco, so it’s just a novel experience.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>I have no idea. That’s kind of what happens when you’re on vacation. I want to go to the Guggenheim, I haven’t done that yet. So I think I might try to do that. I might check out a few other neighborhoods, I’ve never been to Harlem, never been to Queens. So maybe I’ll bike around and see a few new neighborhoods. </p>
