<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I am going over to sign a lease on a new apartment, then going to work.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>My favorite part of the day is mornings. I spend time reading my bible. It’s very refreshing to me, and revitalizing. That’s how I spend my morning: a cup of coffee and God’s word.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’m moving into my new apartment. And then going to work.</p>
