<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Playing bridge, as soon as my compadres come. I'm retired, so I can do whatever I want. I'll be here until about four o'clock, that's when we finish. </p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>When I wake up. Because God has been good to me, I'm not dead. That's my favorite part of any day. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>God willing, playing bridge and counting my money. Then I'll get on my phone and call my lawyer and see what I'm doing.</p>
