<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Well mostly, I have been retired and I'm doing whatever I please today. As I do most every day. I'm going to go up to a friend's. Right now I'm sitting in the park reading my paper. I do that every morning.</p>

<p>This is my backyard. I live two blocks away, over on Waverly and I love living in New York. I love it. I don't know why anybody would want to live anywhere else. Well, that's a little extreme. This is like my backyard. I like coming over here in the morning, I'm too old to enjoy the afternoon and evening nonsense.</p>

<p class="question">What is your favorite part of the day?</p>

<p>I'd have to say, probably morning. Just because I'm an early person. I didn't like to get up and go to work, but I like to get up in the morning. I was a runner for a long time, and ran in the mornings. When my running was over, the best part of my day was over. </p>

<p>It's odd, most of my friends that are retired think I'm nuts. "Why don't you sleep late?" Well, sleeping late has never been something I want to do. So yeah, that's the favorite part.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Gee, I haven't thought that far ahead. I'm going away on Saturday, so I'm taking care of some things for that. I'm going up to Maine for a few days. Some shopping, seeing a friend, nothing very dramatic.</p>
