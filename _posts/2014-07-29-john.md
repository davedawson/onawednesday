<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m fishing. Coming to this pier, hanging out, enjoying the water, the weather, and the beautiful scenery.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Nothing really in particular. I just love coming down here. It’s one of my favorite places. I saw this whole neighborhood change. I moved here twenty years ago from the city. This was nothing but prostitutes and drugs. I watched it change. You couldn’t come on these piers. They looked like that thing over there, sticking out of the rocks. So when all of this got renovated, about fifteen years ago, that’s what I started coming out to the pier.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’ll be at work. I’m a corporate audio visual technician. It’s A/V. I do screens, monitors, computers and audio for corporate events. It changes all the time. I would prefer a set schedule so I can plan accordingly. The way I end up working is I get a call the night before or the morning of. It’s short notice. If I’m lucky, I have a week in advance booked up.</p>

<p>I’m what is called a B-list guy, in what I do. In the union, local 6, the A-listers are guaranteed 35 hours a week and offered overtime. And then whatever’s leftover goes to the B-list guys. So you’re waiting for the phone call to get work.</p>
