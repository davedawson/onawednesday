<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m a gate monitor and I’m checking IDs, making sure that guests and residents are here. I’m also a husband, I’m not a dad yet. I’m sitting here, reading 48 Laws of Power. This is my third read. It’s a good book. I’m enjoying the weather.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Going home. Who wants to be at work all day?</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Same thing. Tomorrow I’m going to the doctor. I just did a physical, so I have to get it checked out. And I’m going to the Gap tomorrow to return some jeans.</p>
