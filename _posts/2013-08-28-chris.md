<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m just on my lunch break right now. I’ve got about an hour left, so I’m just taking it easy. I work in a finance firm in DUMBO and we do a lot of work with financing for copy machines and green energy.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Favorite part of the day is when I go home. I’m a runner, so I like to run at night. It kinds of gets in the way of work, but what can you do?</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Same thing. Working, coming out here for lunch if it’s nice out. Then hopefully tomorrow night, I’ll take my girlfriend out to dinner.</p>
