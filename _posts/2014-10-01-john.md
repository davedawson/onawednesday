<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Working production at Pier 59 on a photo shoot. I'm prepping and wrapping the job, being on set, helping people get here, setting up the catering, setting up the studio.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>When I get done with work, when I can enjoy the city. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Working again. Another photoshoot, different location. At someoneâ€™s apartment on the Upper East Side.</p>
