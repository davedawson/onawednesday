<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m enjoying the view of Bryant Park, watching the skaters go by, enjoying the nice clear day, and enjoying myself.
</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Probably when the sun is out and it’s not too cold.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Probably just taking a walk around the city. Enjoying the sites of the Christmas season. I like to walk for exercise instead of staying home all cooped up, watching TV. I like to get out and get some pounds off. </p>
