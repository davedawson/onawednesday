<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Full body weight workouts. It’s a combination. I start on the other side of the park where the bars are. I do muscle ups, pull ups and push ups. Then I come over here and do my legs, lunges and stretches. The stairs are perfect. Go by two stairs, then three stairs, see if you can do a few jumps. I spend a lot of time doing this. </p>

<p>I’m off today, so I’ll probably be lazy in the evening. I have plans to start martial arts, so I’ll probably do that eventually. I like to learn a bit about everything. </p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Working out. That’s what I’ve been doing since I was 18. For me it’s important. Everyone has their own thing. Some people like this, some people like games. For me, I get into a zen state. It’s a spiritual thing more than it is physical. Test your body, test your mind, test your character. I’m competing against myself. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Probably the same thing. Probably coming out for a few hours and then I gotta get ready for work. I’m a concierge. </p>
