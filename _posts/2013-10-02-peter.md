<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I just took a ride around Manhattan on a bike. I already worked out in the morning, so I ran out of gas after 20 miles. So I’m taking the ferry back. I didn’t feel like going back over the 59th Street Bridge. I can handle it, but it’s too hot now. I came over the 59th Street Bridge, and went over through Central Park and then over to the West Side Highway and picked up the ferry over here to go back to Long Island City, where I live. </p>

<p>I’m going to go home and check on my dog, and then he has to go for grooming at 3 p.m. Then I’ll go for dinner later in the city with my girlfriend. It’s  a day off, you gotta enjoy it!</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Probably just about right now. Being outside is great and this ferry ride helps to cool off. By the time I get off I won’t be sweaty anymore. So this is the best part of the day, right here.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>I have to go back to work, so I won’t be out here.</p>
