<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m actually working, but I’m on lunch break. I work in a machine shop. We fabricate everything. Just whatever needs to be fabricated, we make it. After that, I’ll usually hang out with friends. But on a Wednesday, I’ll probably just get some sleep. It’s too hot to hang out with friends. </p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>I would say right now. This is my favorite part of the day. I don’t have this view where I’m at. I get to come out here, catch the breeze and look at the skyline. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Same thing. Nothing really changes until the weekend.</p>
