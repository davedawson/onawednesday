<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I'm going to go to college at the college of Staten Island. I'm studying biology.</p>

<p class="question">Whatâ€™s your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>When I get home. Because I'm going to be late to my house. I'll be really tired. I just study two days, from the morning to the night. </p>
