<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I'm making coffee most of the day. I'll go home, probably watch a little Netflix, and then hang out with my wife. That's basically my day today. Might go out to dinner. What is tonight? It's Wednesday. We'll probably go to Buttermilk Channel. We live in Carroll Gardens, so we'll probably be going there. </p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>My afternoon nap. I didn't add that before. I usually watch Netflix as I take my afternoon nap. I take a 15-30 minute power nap. That's my favorite part of the day. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll be here again, making coffee. That will be the extent of my day. </p>
