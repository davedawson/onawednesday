<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m working. I’m taking a break now. I work at Scholastic. I work in the office, doing marketing. It’s really boring. I work with a wonderful group of people. But basically it’s just work. I work long hours, so I don’t get home until like 8 o’clock. So, I’m probably the most boring person you’ll interview. I get to work at 9:30, I try to leave by 7:30. And that’s it.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>When I get home and relax. It’s not so bad. Work is not bad. I know we make an impact on kids and teachers. I’m a former teacher. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Thursday. Back to the old grind, really. I work six days a week. I have a second job. I live in Jersey and my second job is helping out the nuns in Jersey. I work on Saturdays in the fundraising office. I do their books, basically. I’ve known the nuns forever and I used to work in the school. But it was always my dream to work at Scholastic. I like publishing and I’m in the marketing department.</p>
