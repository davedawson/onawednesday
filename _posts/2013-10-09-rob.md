<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Obviously attending Brooklyn Beta. Also visiting Brooklyn while I’m in town for a team meeting at Editorially. That’s my day today.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Getting to hang out with a lot of good friends that I don’t get to see very often.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Brooklyn Beta, again. Pretty much the same thing, but I think I’m going to start off the day with a nice, long run through Prospect Park, which will be nice. </p>
