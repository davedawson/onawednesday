<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Ice skating, then going to Nelson A. Rockefeller Park, then watching a movie. Sort of a good Wednesday. I took off work today, so it should be eventful.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Probably getting home. It’s relaxing. Usually I try to book my days. So I usually go to work and then the gym, maybe meet up with buddies and then just head home. That’s the best part of the day.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Also taking off work. My girlfriend is still in school. This is her last week, so I’m just trying to spend all my time with her. I have the next few months to just work my ass of, so that’s what I’ll do.</p>
