<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Just visiting. We wanted to go to the United Nations building but we didn’t buy our tickets. But maybe tomorrow we’ll return to the United Nations building and tonight we’ll buy some tickets. This afternoon we’ll go to the Trinity Church.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Grand Central Station. I searched for information on the website and found out about the kissing room. To say goodbye to their parents or their wives or husbands.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>We’ll visit Broadway, the United Nations and Central Park.</p>
