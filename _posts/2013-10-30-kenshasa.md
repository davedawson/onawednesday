<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Today I’m walking my dog in the park, I have a couple of appointments, and I have a meeting later on this evening. I am an international distributor of organic coffee and teas. I have meetings today around that.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Oh actually this is one of my favorite parts of the day. Just getting out into the fresh air, the morning air, before all the fumes get into it. Having Fudge [the dog] interact with other pets, it’s just wonderful. I enjoy it very much.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow I have a workshop. I’m a psychologist and I do workshops on stress management. So I have a workshop tomorrow at 8:30 in the morning.</p>
