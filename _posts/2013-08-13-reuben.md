<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I woke up early, so I'm going to skate for a while, then go to work. And then probably meet up with some friends afterwards, kick back a little.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Probably the morning. I'm an early riser, I just wake up and I'm ready to go. I get out before a lot of my friends do. I get a lot more time skating, which is nice. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow I have work, so similar to today. Until I get off for a few days.</p>
