<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I'm working until 10 this morning, then probably go home and take a nap because I was here at 6. And then I have a basketball game at 6:45, then I'll probably go out after to some party at 9:30. And then I have school in the morning, so that's it.</p>

<p class="question">Whatâ€™s your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Probably the nap part. It's relaxing. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>I have school. First day of school at Queensboro.</p>
