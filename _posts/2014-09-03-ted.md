<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Well as soon as I’m done walking my dog, I’m going to go to work. I’m a carpenter and I work in the neighborhood here. </p>

<p>I walk her until late morning. Then I work until dusk. I go back and make dinner for me and my wife. Then, I have a drink and relax.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Probably having a drink at night. A glass of beer. Turning on the radio and listening to music with my wife. WQXR, classicical . We both agree on it. It’s neutral territory.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Same thing I’m doing today.</p>
