<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>We’re doing GPS observation for a mapping project. After Sandy, this area was flooded, so the MTA is looking to protect their underground structures from flooding again. This is part of that project.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>The view. The view isn’t here on all of the days. I worked in this area like fifteen years ago. It was a dump area, no buildings, just homelessness, dirt and debris. Now look at it.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>The same.</p>
