<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Going to work at the United Nations. I work in the Conflict Prevention Office. It’s quite interesting. After work I have to pack because I’m traveling tomorrow. I’m going to Finland and then to Lebanon.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>The morning, if it’s sunny and warm. Today it’s at least sunny but it’s not warm. It’s a fresh start.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’ll be traveling to Finland. My flight is in the evening, so I’ll be at work and then I’ll be traveling to Finland.</p>
