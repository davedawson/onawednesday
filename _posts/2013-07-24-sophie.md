<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>

<p>Well I went to try the bakery, Kayser. It's just around there. It's a French guy and they just started opening a new store and it's really, really good. I got bread and a raspberry financier.</p>

<p class="question">Is that all you have planned today?</p>

<p>Well, it's very private. But actually, I took the day off because I'm pregnant and I have a big doctor appointment, so I just didn't want to rush from work.</p>

<p class="question">Congratulations! That's really exciting. And what time did you wake up today?</p>

<p>Like 7.</p>

<p class="question">And what is your favorite part of the day?</p>

<p>I have an almost two year old son, so it's when I pick him up at day care. He is all happy and I am happy too.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>

<p>Back to work. It's not so fun.</p>
