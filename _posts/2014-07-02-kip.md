<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Umm, today I’m running around trying to get paperwork from one place, one doctors office to another doctors office because I have knee surgery on the third. So, I have to provide it before they can determine whether the surgery, they can do it, and whether the cause of the surgery for my knee is coming from here, here, or here [points to hip and back]. That’s the other thing I’m doing today.

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>When no one else is around. The quietest part, well, I mean, that’s a hard question. The quietest part, after all the nightclubs cool down.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>I’m putting together a business, so getting back to work on that.</p>
