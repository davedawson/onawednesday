<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I'm working for MTA, doing customer service. I'm letting everyone know that there is no R service going Brooklyn bound. I'll be here until around 12:20 - 12:30. I've been here for two weeks straight.</p>

<p>I work general field, so I could be anywhere. I could be at a station, giving information on how to get to your destination, or I can be riding on the bus, doing a ride check. So I could be doing anything.</p>

<p class="question">Whatâ€™s your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Getting off. I actually work two jobs, so I leave here and go to another one. Everyday I work two jobs besides Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Because Thursday and Friday are my days off with the MTA, and then I'm a custodian at PS179 and my days off are Friday, Saturday there. I need to rest at least two or three hours in a day. Sometimes I'm just tired. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll be working as a custodian. Just a custodian tomorrow. But Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, it's pretty competitive with the two jobs. </p>
