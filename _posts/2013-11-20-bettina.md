<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m going to check out Manhattan. I got here yesterday, so we’re walking here, then to check out the 9/11 Memorial. Hope to get some dim sum in Chinatown, then maybe walk the High Line. I’m a tourist.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Probably when I come home from work to see my girls. I have two girls. I get home from work, it’s been a decent day at the office. I get home and see them and disconnect for a few hours.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>I’m going to go to the MoMA. Walk a little bit, see a bit of 5th Avenue and that whole area. Probably going to walk around the East Village. I’m not really sure, but I’ll definitely go see the MoMA.</p>
