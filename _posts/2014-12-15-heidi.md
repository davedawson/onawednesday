<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Today it’s a little slow because it’s Monday and people are working. So I was writing in my personal book about my experience, because I don’t want to forget. Usually we sell more during the evenings. So what I do is cut some tree and pass the broom. I make sure everything is clean because if it’s not clean they don’t want us to keep the stand. So everything is clean and cute for Manhattan. Everything needs to be perfect here. At night we’re here. We’re trained to be out here and smile at clients.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>When my friends is here and we work together. We’re working here 24/7. When I’m alone for a really long time, I’m like “oh my god” but when she comes out we can speak. A lot of people do 12 hour shifts. But because we’re social people we wouldn’t be able to do twelve hours alone, so we do six hours each and then we work together for six hours.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>It’s always the same. There’s never the same amount of people every day, so we’re just waiting. Weekends are the busy time.</p>
