<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m cooking lamb and chicken for anybody. It’s good. I’ve been here since one or two o'clock. They have the bar here, everybody after they finish their drink, comes here to eat. I come here around 7 pm, until around one or two o’clock. If it’s busy, 2 o’clock. This cart is not mine. I work for three bosses. I work here and I work in a garage down the street, four blocks from here. </p>

<p>The cart here is the best, everyone tells me. I love everybody and everybody loves me. </p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>I work at night. I see everybody here. These are my customers, I’ve worked here for two years. I know everybody here, and everybody knows me. I joke around with everybody like this. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>I work tomorrow. It will rain tomorrow, so business will be slow. When you have rain or snow, I’ll see like ten or twenty customers. Everyone is at home. Tomorrow I’ll leave early because of the rain. My boss tells me there’s no business in the rain.</p>
