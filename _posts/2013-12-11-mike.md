<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m selling Christmas trees on 14th street &amp; 9th avenue. Usually I’m here all day. The shifts run 12 or 11 hours. We have another stand over in Brooklyn. They have two shifts a day. One during the day and one at night.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Getting here is the easiest, you’re still fresh. By the end of the day, you’re cold and miserable. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’ll be back here. Same thing.</p>
