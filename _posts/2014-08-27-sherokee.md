<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m waiting for my daughter to get out of school today. We’re going to get some school stuff, some stockings and some shoes. And then I think I’m going to take a nap before my run.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Maybe lunch time. We get to eat! I love to eat.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>I’m working tomorrow, probably.</p>
