<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Iâ€™m seeing city sights all day. I started off on 51st st., in Midtown. I was planning to visit Williamsburg.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Maybe the sunset. That hour of the day. The temperature is better.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow, maybe seeing the upper part of the city. Central Park, and Riverside Park.</p>
