<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m on my lunch break right now. I work in this building over here. </p>

<p class="question">Do you enjoy it?</p>
<p>No. </p>

<p class="question">What’s your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Five minutes before 4pm. [What happens at 4pm?] Work ends and I get to go home.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Same exact thing. It’s like that movie, Groundhog Day, everything is the same, every day. </p>
