<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m at Brooklyn Beta. This is my first time, so I’m sort of figuring it out as it goes. It’s been fun. Nice to meet people and talk a bit.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Hard to say. Lunch was great. A friend of mine from Chicago is here, and  I noticed him and we ate lunch together. It was nice to catch up. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>I’ll be here again tomorrow.</p>
