<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m walking dogs. From 8:30 to around 3:30, Monday through Friday. Weekends I’m off. It started as a side thing, because I’m a retired police officer. I love it. It’s really fun. The dogs are sometimes better than hanging out with people. They go with the flow. In general, I pick up the dog and walk it for a half hour or an hour, depending on what the customer wants. I have the same dogs pretty much every day. The clients like that consistency, and the dogs like it too. I get my schedule, I do what I’ve got to do and I don’t have a boss looking over my shoulder.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>I’d say the afternoon. Everyone has already gone to work and you’re not dealing with people trying to get the kids to school and getting to work. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Same thing, same schedule.</p>
