<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m here after work. This is my friends’ place. It’s the biggest sports bar in Brooklyn. I came to get something to eat and talk to a couple people, see if they were interested in helping out and donating some time for the kids. It’s the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SecretSandyClausProject">Secret Sandy Clause project</a>. If you know someone that needs a toy, you put down a toy that they want and they will get it. </p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>I guess when I wake up and have nothing to do. I can just kick back and grab a newspaper, grab a book and just relax. They are very far and few between.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow is an ordeal. I’m off tomorrow. I’ll go see my granddaughter and daughter tomorrow. It’s a great day. </p>
