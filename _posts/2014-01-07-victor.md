<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I went to the Apple store to fix my Macbook. It had some problems, so I got it fixed. Now I’m about to meet with my sister. She’s over at 42nd, in Times Square. We were trying to decide if we should meet over there or meet over here. I think she’s going to come over here. So I’m just waiting for her.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Probably when I go home after a long day. Just coming home to a home cooked meal is my favorite part of the day.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’ll be taking a final. I have to take a philosophy final. I have to study tonight, it’s going to suck.</p>
