<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>We’ve just come across from the Statue of Liberty. We went on the helicopter tour this morning. We’re going to Ground Zero this afternoon. We’re just going over to Brooklyn now to get some lunch. Then we’ll hop back across for the 9/11 memorial and some Chinatown. </p>

<p>We’ve just put a lock on the side here. It’s similar to the one that they’ve got in France. The bridge where you throw away the key to symbolize everlasting love.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Well the helicopter ride was the best. We got to see everything from there. We got a bit of an idea of the layout. Times Square is pretty breathtaking. Quite intense. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>I think we’re going to do the Empire State Building tomorrow. And then just some shopping on 5th Avenue. We’re here for 6 days. </p>
