<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I'm waiting for my wife who has a 12:30 appointment in this building over there. Then we're going to go home we’ll cook some dinner.</p>

<p class="question">What time did you wake up?</p>
<p>Oh man, I woke up at 5:30 this morning. [is that when you leave for work?] Well, that's when I head out of the house.</p>

<p class="question">Where do you live?</p>
<p>We live out by Coney Island. We took the subway here today.</p>

<p class="question">What is your favorite part of the day? </p>
<p>12 noon. That’s when I go to prayer at the church over on Fulton. I like it. It keeps me focused and away from the shenanigans of the city.</p>
