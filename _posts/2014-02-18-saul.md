<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I just got out of school and I’m about to go rock climbing right now at Brooklyn Boulders and then I’ll come back to school. I’m going to school for mechanical engineering.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>When I get to go home and sleep. That’s pretty much it.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>I’ll be up early again to come to school. After school I got to go to work. Then after that, I’ll go home and sleep again.</p>
