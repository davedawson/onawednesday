<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>We’re taking a Tai Chi sword class with Rebecca, our teacher. This is our first time in the park, usually we’re in her loft. We’re all excited that we beat the rain. I was teaching earlier and I’m going to teach right now.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Every day is different, so it depends on what that day entails. If it’s a day when I don’t teach first period, but I teach second period, I like that day. Coming home knowing there’s a glass of wine waiting for me as I enter the house. I like that. Weekends are pretty nice, when you don’t work. But each day is different. Today was a good day. My favorite part is right now, doing Tai Chi in the park.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’m teaching full time.</p>
