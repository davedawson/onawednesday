<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m working here. Selling hotdogs, waters, gatorades.</p>

<p class="question">How long have you been doing this?</p>
<p>1 week. I’ve been in this country for 6 months.</p>

<p class="question">What time did you wake up this morning?</p>
<p>I woke up at 8am. Then I took the subway here. I clean my stand, wipe it down and then my boss brings it here. I’ve been here one week, my boss was on this corner for four years.</p>

<p class="question">Do you enjoy this?</p>
<p>I enjoy having a job. In this country people are just lucky to have a job. So I’m happy that I have this. Before, when I didn’t have a job, my head was all over the place. But now I’m focused.</p>
