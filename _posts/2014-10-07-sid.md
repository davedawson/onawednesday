<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m coming back from work and collecting my vegetables as part of a CSA, then I’m going home and cooking them. I think I’m getting tomatoes, peppers and some greens. I’m making lentils with tomatoes and rice. Don’t want to spend too much time cooking.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Mornings, because I feel fresh. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Thursday, right? Pretty similar to today. Nothing extra special. I’m a software engineer, so lots of meetings.</p>
