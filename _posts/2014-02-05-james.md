<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m at work, selling cosmetic products. Later I’ll be listening to some music, because I love music. I like to make music. </p>

<p class="question">What kind of music?</p>
<p>R&amp;B, but I just do it for fun right now. It’s a hobby. </p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>It may sound crazy, but it’s the morning. You don’t know how the day is going to start. It’s spontaneous. It’s unknown. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I’m doing the same thing. Working and networking with people, as usual. </p>
