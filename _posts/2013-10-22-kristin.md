<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Well I’m on vacation. I used to live here. And I’m actually walking now from Greenpoint, I think it’s Clay street. So, I’m walking all the way across the Williamsburg Bridge. I really have no plans. I’m choosing to not hang out with people and just kind of see where the day goes.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>My favorite part of the day is morning, definitely. It’s kind of quiet and cozy. People are just getting going, so it’s a good time to think and walk and look.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Well tonight I’m actually headed up to Cape Cod with friends from the city. We’re going to go up there for a few days. I live in Northern Michigan, Traverse City. I was in the city for ten years, and then after 9/11 I just wanted to go settle elsewhere. So I did! </p>
