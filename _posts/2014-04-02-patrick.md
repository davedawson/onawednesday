<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Today I’m working until 4 o’clock. Then I’ll hit the gym right after work. After that I’ll probably cook dinner. I thought about making pasta and meatballs. And I’ll see my girlfriend. I make my own sauce, so I like to do that on occasion. </p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>When I leave work. Today is actually payday, so that means I get to go cash my check and pay bills. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>I have to work from 8:30 until 4, and then probably go to the gym again. No, no I don’t. Tomorrow is my day off! So I’ll probably sleep in, eat junk food, go to the gym and feel guilty about it. That’s about it. I might go out with some friends. I’ll see how it goes. </p>
