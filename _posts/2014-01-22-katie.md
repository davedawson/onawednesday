<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m just coming from the Agenda trade show. I wish that my day was ending now, but I’m heading back to my office.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Walking out of the office at the end of the day. Then I get to go off and do whatever I want. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Very similar to today. The trade show is in town and it’s two days, so I’ll be back there. </p>
