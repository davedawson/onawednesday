<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Right now, I’m at work all day today. I work at a retail store, I won’t say which one. But I’m just working today.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Doing something active. I’m big on fitness, so usually I go to the gym after work or play a little basketball. That’s how I like to end my days. Being 6’4”, you kind of get thrown into sports early.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>It is my day off. So what I usually like to do is start my day at the gym, because that’s the best part. Get myself in a good mood. I’ll probably hang out with some friends. I have a list of things that I want to get done throughout the year, whether that’s going to a good show, or taking a vacation. So I’ll try to cross something off the list.</p>
