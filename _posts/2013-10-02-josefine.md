<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m on a visit. A ferry ride, just came from the heat in New York. I’m going to the Staten Island ferry. Sight seeing, I just want to get out of Manhattan.</p>

<p>Later, I don’t have plans really. I just decide continuously what I feel like doing. Go in a restaurant, have some lunch, how I feel. No stress, no time pressure on vacation. </p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>For me, it’s breakfast time. Entering the coffee shop, relax and drink a coffee. Start the day in a relaxed way.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>I have no idea. I think I will decide tomorrow morning. Take the city map and what will come, I don’t know yet.</p>
