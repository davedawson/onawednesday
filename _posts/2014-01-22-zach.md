<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I just got down here. I’m waiting for my friend. I’m a student at LIM college and we had off today because school’s cancelled. It’s not really that bad out. She’s interviewing for a job around the corner. Not sure what we’re going to do, we’ll probably play it by ear.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>I guess waking up. It’s a new day, a fresh start. I feel relaxed. Get ready to start the day and do whatever you need to do.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>School isn’t cancelled tomorrow, so gotta go back to school. </p>
