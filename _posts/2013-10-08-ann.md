<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Well since it’s Indian summer, I’m taking more time in the morning to be outside and workout, although I have a lot of work to do. And I’m also on Pan American Organization, the translation committee, so half the day we’ll be in Manhattan, and then I’ll go to a meeting this evening. So half the day in Brooklyn, half the day in Manhattan. </p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>The morning. Always. I like the light, I like the cooler temperature if it’s a warmer season. It always seems hopeful. I have this big shoot of energy around 2:30, and then I come out of that and then I’m better in the early evening. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>I’m taking care of admin stuff today. So I’ll get back to poetry tomorrow. It’s best in the morning, writing poetry. I do believe in the idea that when you wake up, you’re still open to some other sort of dream world and everything that is still going on in your subconscious, so it’s an effective time to write. And you don’t listen to the radio or bring in the bad news before you start.</p>
