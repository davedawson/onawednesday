<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m heading home to write some music and play some bass. I just came from a coffee shop up on Flatbush called Hungry Ghost. I was working there, pouring some espresso. I do that a few days a week, and otherwise I'm just writing music and playing.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>Probably the evening, right around dinner time. I like to cook. My fiance comes home and we make some dinner and drink some wine.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow is my day off, so I haven’t really made any plans. We’re leaving the city soon, so I’ll probably take care of some odds and ends, book a U-Haul trailer. We’re from Canada, so we’re heading back to where we’re from. We’ll spend the summer in a Prince Edward Island. It will be a nice break from the city.</p>
