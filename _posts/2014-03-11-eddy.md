<p>I’m up early in the morning, 9 o’clock. I study from 9 o’clock to 1 o’clock. I study Jewish studies. Then I come to the Square and buy some books. Later I’m going to meet my friend to study.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>When I finish studying. I know that I’ve accomplished what I set out to do.</p>
