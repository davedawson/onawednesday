<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>I’m looking for an address, but someone gave me the wrong address. So I’m waiting for these people to call me back. That’s the reason why I’m here. I’m waiting for the people to call me back and give me the exact address. I’m a window cleaner, so I need the exact address.</p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>I’ll go to some place between 11th and 10th avenues and 34th street to find a place to eat dinner.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’ll start work early, 5 o’clock. After 11 sometimes I have nothing, sometimes I have something. Today I had something. It's early, but I work inside so it’s not so cold.</p>
