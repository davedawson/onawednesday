<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>

<p>What am I doing? I’m hanging out in Brimfield. I had a little bit of fun though. I’m going to be here all day. I’ll be here until Sunday. It’s an awful lot of work. So when you get tired and discouraged, you just have fun. You go to your neighbors, you steal some letters, you spell out some things. As long as it’s not too naughty. I don’t want to get kicked out of the field. But it’s a beautiful day. It’s gorgeous out. I people watch too while I’m here.</p>

<p>I don’t know how many years I’ve been coming here, you’ll have to ask one of these other folks. I shopped here 30 years ago. This might be year number six that I’ve actually set up here. </p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>

<p>I like first thing in the morning. I get up at like 4. Nobody else is up, it’s quiet, it’s dark. I have my coffee and I can take my time to set up and do my thing. </p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>Same thing. I might do a little shopping tomorrow. Just in this field, this is the best field. It’s just comfortable, it’s easy going, not just straight rows of tents. I think this used to be a campsite. I get along with everybody in here. Everybody is pretty cool in this field. It’s only sometimes the patrons are fighting with each other. It’s entertainment. </p>
