<p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
<p>Well I’m a retired guy, and I went to a senior center for lunch and talked to some people. I left there and took a long walk, but it’s really windy today. I walked to Eighth Avenue because I wanted to go to the Joyce Theater. It’s a theater known for dance. I just was inquiring about their spring season. Now I’m heading towards Sixth Avenue to do a little shopping. Nothing much today. I’m busy Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. </p>

<p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
<p>It all depends on who I’m with. I would say the afternoons. Mornings I tend to be home. I do a number of things, taking my time reading the paper, maybe have the TV on. I get out in the afternoon. I’ll go to the senior center, not all the days, it depends. I have various activities at the senior center too. It all depends on the schedule that they have. So I spend some time over there. Afterwards I return home, maybe have an activity in the evening.</p>

<p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
<p>I’m going to the movies and then a Ukrainian restaurant on the East side.</p>
