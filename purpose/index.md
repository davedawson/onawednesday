#Purpose

There are a lot of people out there.

We’re curious what they’re doing, where they came from, what they look forward to, who they live with.

*On a Wednesday* is a project to collect a few of those stories. A few quick questions and a photo can be all you need to catch a glimpse into someone else’s world.
